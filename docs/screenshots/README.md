# Screenshots

The product end to end, as it ran on the live Sahoshi stack on the Kolkata City Pack on 29 Oct 2026, 22:50–23:40 IST
(the deck on port 5373 of the one on-premises server). They are placed beside the text they explain in
[`README.md`](../../README.md), [`PRODUCT.md`](../../PRODUCT.md) (§6, screen by screen),
[`TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`](../TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md), [`DESIGN_NOTES.md`](../DESIGN_NOTES.md) and
[`SAMPLE_DATA_AND_TESTS.md`](../SAMPLE_DATA_AND_TESTS.md); the README's gallery has them all.

## How they were taken

- **The camera:** [`scripts/showcase/console_shots.mjs`](../../scripts/showcase/console_shots.mjs) re-takes the whole
  set (`--list` prints it). Console screens at 1440 × 900, the three live-map heroes at 1920 × 1080, signed in as
  "Demo duty officer" (a console screen needs a named officer, so the registration marks it shows are the emulated
  EM-series exercise marks); the public pages in an anonymous browser, so marks stay masked there, the phone pages
  at 390 × 844 rendered at 2× (780 × 1688). JPEG quality 85. English throughout, except `home-bn.jpg` (the console
  in Bengali) and `voice-report.jpg` (a report spoken in Bengali).
- **Read-only:** the camera answers every write to the deck itself (no approval, rejection, dispatch, plan, escort
  or field report was sent); only the AI services' compute calls (speech, vision, twin, hydro, forecast), the
  assistant's chat turn and the map's live traffic read pass. The live map was given 60–90 s to fill its roads,
  places, readings and units before each map shot.
- **The staged evening:** `scripts/demo_reset.sh --apply --cancel-debris` (Durga Puja night in North Kolkata and the
  cloudburst at high tide, both SIMULATED; the stolen-vehicle sweep: EMULATED ANPR reads of the exercise vehicle
  WB06EM9001 under a demo FIR, one sighting PENDING for an officer), then `scripts/demo_tour.sh seed event-library
  escort green-corridor dss` (the scenario library's events, the Nabanna → Kolkata Airport protected movement with
  EMULATED convoy GPS, ambulance (108) corridor requests and one decision-support case). Both were reset afterwards.
- **What is live:** the rain nowcast, the city feeds (air, heat, cyclone, river, earthquake), the official weather
  warning and the reported situations (official notices and news, aggregate, at places; crime, clashes and politics
  are refused at ingest and none is shown here). Traffic is SIMULATED and every such figure says so.
- **Waterlogging:** Kolkata was dry that night (class 0 on every road is the honest answer), so the waterlogging
  shots use the console's replay of the 22–23 Sep 2025 storm, labelled **Hindsight**, as the console offers it.
- **Voice reports:** synthetic voices (the speech service's own TTS) played into a fake microphone and transcribed
  by the live ASR on this server; nothing was sent to the board.
- **The masked mark:** `decide-masked.jpg` shows a console with no officer named. The live deck shows no console
  page without a signed-in officer, so it was taken on a development deck (port 5383) serving the same code and
  reading the same live stack with the operator gate off, the camera's write refusal on.
- **The 3D city:** Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles through Cesium ion, labelled "not a live image" on screen.
- Nothing is edited apart from the JPEG encoding.

## Not shown, and why

- **The routes step of Plan.** Find routes registers a labelled movement with the planner, an officer's press; the
  camera never writes, so `plan.jpg` stops at step 1 and `map-escort.jpg` shows a protected movement that was
  already running (the emulated base case).
- **An e-challan on the theft victim's vehicle.** The reject-only rule shows on a pending e-challan of the stolen
  exercise vehicle; the evening's reset had rejected the last one and none was pending while the set was taken, so
  none was staged or faked. The rule is visible on the vehicle's page (`object-vehicle.jpg`: "Evidence only. No
  e-challan for a stolen vehicle's owner").
- **Authorise pursuit as step 1, and the interception plan.** An officer had authorised the exercise sighting earlier
  that evening (decisions are final), so the stolen-vehicle sheet stands at step 2, Open the pursuit; the choke plan
  appears only once an officer opens the pursuit, which the camera does not do.
