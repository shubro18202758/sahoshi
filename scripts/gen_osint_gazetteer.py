"""gen_osint_gazetteer.py — Sahoshi's offline OSINT place gazetteer (contract X19), rebuilt deterministically.

Writes ``scripts/data/osint_gazetteer.json``: the places the geo-resolver (``services/osint-geo``) can name, each
with its spellings, a point, an importance prior and, for the network's own features, its id. Places only: no
field outside the X19 list exists, and no person's name ever becomes a phrase on its own.

Inputs (all in the repo, offline):

* ``scripts/data/osm_network.json`` (read only; ``gen_osm_network.py`` owns it): the city's ``junctions`` (English
  and Bengali names, OSM node points) and road ``segments`` (road names, the OSM names along each, the stored
  line). © OpenStreetMap contributors, ODbL 1.0;
* ``cities/<city>/gazetteer.json``, the City Pack's place table (the source of truth for every place that is not
  a network feature): neighbourhoods, low-lying spots, off-network streets, terminals, bridges, ghats, hospitals,
  venues, Durga Puja pandals and police stations, each with English, Bengali and Hindi names and the romanised
  variants and misspellings seen in local text; plus extra forms for the network's junctions (``junction_aliases``,
  by junction key) and roads (``road_aliases``, by base road name). Hand rows carry approximate, reviewable
  points; police stations come from the pack's OSM extract (ODbL);
* ``cities/<city>/landmarks.json``: the canonical names (the Hindi name of a junction named after a landmark);
* ``osint_geo.translit``: the Bengali and Hindi place-word tables and Latin variants.

What each entry's ``surface_forms`` hold (every form in the resolver's normal form, ``osint_geo.gazetteer.norm``):

* junction (gaz_ids 1..J, the network's ids): its name, the name without the parenthesis ("Kalighat (SP Mukherjee
  Road)" → "Kalighat"), the Bengali name with and without its parenthesis, its Latin transliteration, its Hindi
  name (landmarks.json) and the pack's aliases ("gariahat more", "গড়িয়াহাটের মোড়"). A junction never carries a
  form a pack place carries (F-HONEST OSINT-1: "Gariahat" alone is the neighbourhood, "Sealdah" the station, never
  a junction pin), nor a bare word two junctions share. Unlike the first build, no bare first word of a junction
  name is added: in Kolkata it is a surname ("Hazra"), a person's name ("Rashbehari"), a company ("Exide") or an
  area;
* road (the network's segments, gaz_ids J+1..): its name, its base name, the OSM names along it — a linear name
  covering at least 10 % (and 100 m) or 200 m of it, a point-like name (a crossing, circle or bridge) at any length
  unless it is a junction's own name; ``(unnamed)`` and generic-only names left out — and the pack's colloquial
  forms of the road ("em bypass", "chowringhee", "ইএম বাইপাস", "ajc bose road"). Its point is the segment's anchor,
  ``ST_PointOnSurface`` of the line (``osint_geo.geom.interior_point``), where the oracle places the segment;
* pack place (gaz_ids after the roads, in pack order): its English name and base name, its variants, its Bengali
  and Hindi names and variants, and the Latin variants of ``translit``. ``anchor`` sets how it meets the network:
  ``area`` → X19 ``neighbourhood`` semantics (no road anchor; an off-network street is never pinned to another
  road), ``snap`` (the resolver snaps it to the nearest segment within 900 m), ``J<id>`` / ``S<id>`` (pre-linked
  to that junction or segment).

The gaz_ids are positional (network order, then pack order), so a regenerated file keeps every id while the inputs
keep their order. A lint (:func:`lint`) refuses a build in which a multi-word Latin phrase carries no place-type
word or road code (the rule of ``osint-common``'s ``test_gazetteer_phrases_are_places_never_bare_person_names``),
a form is not in normal form, a form is a bare generic word, or a junction shares a form with a pack place.
``generated_at`` is the OpenStreetMap extract time of the network it was built from, so the same inputs give a
byte-identical file.

Usage (the standard library alone: ``osint_geo.gazetteer``, ``translit`` and ``geom`` import nothing else, so any
Python 3.12 runs it, gates included; paths resolve from the repo root):

    python scripts/gen_osint_gazetteer.py            # build in memory, report counts and whether the file differs
    python scripts/gen_osint_gazetteer.py --check    # exit 1 when the committed file differs from a rebuild
    python scripts/gen_osint_gazetteer.py --write    # rewrite scripts/data/osint_gazetteer.json
    python scripts/gen_osint_gazetteer.py --overpass [--overpass-json FILE]
        # opt-in, never used by gates: list OSM place nodes in the city bbox that the gazetteer lacks, for a
        # reviewer to add to the pack by hand (one Overpass request, or a saved response with --overpass-json)
