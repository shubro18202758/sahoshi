# showcase_run.sh — the FLAGSHIP demonstration: "GOD'S-EYE EVENING OVER KOLKATA".
#
# One Puja night over Kolkata, end to end, no arguments, through the real
# HTTP APIs of the RUNNING stack (every scenario EMULATED / SIMULATED and
# labelled so; every approval a named officer's):
#
#   21:30  MAHA NAVAMI NIGHT, NORTH KOLKATA (use case durga_puja_north,
#          SIMULATED). Pandal-hoppers spill off the footpaths around
#          Kumartuli Park, Bagbazar Sarbojanin, Bidhan Sarani (Hatibagan) and
#          College Square; goods vehicles are kept off the pandal belts for the
#          night (modelled as fewer heavy-vehicle breakdowns); closure policy
#          signal_hold — the crowd is regulated, not stopped. Injected through
#          the event emulator's HTTP API into the RUNNING fleet.
#   21:3x  CLOUDBURST AT HIGH TIDE (use case cloudburst_high_tide,
#          SIMULATED). Rain modelled at 100 mm/h while the Hooghly is at high
#          water (MODELLED tide phase): the outfall gates are shut, the pumps
#          carry the load, and Thanthania on Bidhan Sarani (segment 1058)
#          waterlogs first. The hydro service is asked for its proposals: the
#          LIVE nowcast (Open-Meteo rain; tonight may be dry, and then it
#          proposes nothing — recorded as such) and the 23 Sep 2025 storm
#          replay (HINDSIGHT, MODELLED: reroute, ambulance window, live-wire
#          request, advisory draft).
#   21:4x  A CARDIAC AMBULANCE (108) asks for a green corridor across Howrah
#          Bridge to Kolkata Medical College: Howrah Bridge -> Strand Bank Road
#          past Kumartuli -> Bagbazar Street -> Bidhan Sarani. The escalation
#          channel decides AMBULANCE_DELAY mid-crowd and the twin's audited
#          schedule opens the green-corridor windows (emergency_vehicle) on
#          Strand Bank Road, Bagbazar Street and Bidhan Sarani.
#   21:5x  A STOLEN VEHICLE is reported (FIR 4401/2026, Hare Street PS — a
#          scenario reference; plate WB06EM9001, an EMULATED mark). The chain
#          runs through the real stack — vehicles only, never a fine for the
#          theft victim (C-N):
#            plate EARMARKED (flagged, lawful basis stolen_vehicle_fir)
#            -> emulated ANPR sightings on the Kolkata camera sites (the
#               watchlist sweep's belt: Howrah Bridge, Strand Road, Brabourne
#               Road, Chittaranjan Avenue; matched_plate_hit 'stolen_vehicle',
#               source 'emulated_anpr')
#            -> one EVIDENCE-ONLY R_STOLEN_SIGHTING per read: the penal
#               rules still run, but their e-challan is WITHHELD — PENDING, a
#               proposal only
#            -> APPROVAL of the newest sighting by the clearly labelled
#               "Scripted demo officer (showcase script)": 'pursuit
#               authorised on a reported-stolen vehicle (evidence, no fine)';
#               an e-challan approval on the plate is REFUSED (409)
#            -> PURSUIT EVENT (vehicle_pursuit, EMULATED, carrying vehicle_id
#               + recommendation_id)
#            -> INTERCEPTION PLAN (pgRouting choke-junction ranking off the
#               latest sighting)
#            -> LIVE TRACE on the God's-eye canvas (GET /api/v1/vehicles/{id}/trace)
#            -> the scripted pursuit CLOSED when the run ends (C-F
#               cancelled): nothing an unattended script opened stays open on
#               /ops or holds a band for the situation engine.
#   22:0x  CIVIC VOLUNTEERS (the platform's agency code jan_rakshak) are
#          dispatched to the Bagbazar Sarbojanin crowd spill on Bagbazar
#          Street: requested -> approved -> en_route -> on_scene, every
#          transition audited, the emulated unit projected live.
#   22:1x  The city SIGNAL-POLICY ENGINE answers the situation band: the twin
#          calibration replay is run (honest numbers recorded), the live
#          band's city plan is applied for the evening, and the C7 shadow-eval
#          guard REFUSES the commit while the twin is uncalibrated — fail-closed
#          BY DESIGN, fully audited in GET /api/v1/signals/plans.
#   22:2x  A VIP MOVEMENT, Nabanna -> Kolkata Airport, is PLANNED only
#          (convoy-brain's pre-movement workflow: ranked routes, the decider's
#          pick, the corridor event registered in 'planning'); nothing is
#          launched, and the scripted plan is closed when the run ends.
#
# What this script proves, in order:
#   1. HEALTH   — the fleet's containers + host models + emulator (checked
#                 on connectivity) + deck (one operator sign-in), fail fast
#                 with the exact fix hint if not. The city signal-plan writer
#                 must already be ON (sahoshi_up.sh --demo); the live stack's
#                 containers are never recreated by this script unless
#                 SHOWCASE_ALLOW_RECREATE=1 (then phase 8d, or the exit trap,
#                 puts the writer back to its pre-run value).
#   2. ACTION   — every beat above through the emulator + real APIs.
#   3. ASSERT   — the real stack did the work, each verifiable from
#                 API/store state: audit-log decision rows, band
#                 transitions, green-corridor windows, the hydro proposals,
#                 the signal-policy guard decision, every pursuit-chain step,
#                 the VIP plan.
#   4. EVIDENCE — headless SwiftShader screenshots of the CANVAS (the
#                 deck's /gods-eye 3D city, signed in, and the /citizen
#                 advisory as the public sees it — the pursuit and every
#                 plate kept off it), each proven non-blank at the pixel
#                 level (scripts/showcase/canvas_shots.mjs), into the
#                 output dir (showcase/).
#   5. RESULT   — showcase_results.json in the output dir (with this
#                 run's emulator run ids and event ids) + nonzero exit on
#                 ANY failed assertion.
#
# Approvals: in a live demo a signed-in HUMAN approves on /ops (and
# scripts/demo_reset.sh stops at PENDING for exactly that); this script runs
# unattended, so the two approvals it makes (the Civic Volunteers dispatch,
# the stolen-vehicle sighting that authorises the pursuit) are recorded under
# the officer label "Scripted demo officer (showcase script)".
#
# Usage: bash scripts/showcase_run.sh     (no arguments)
# Env:   CHROME_PATH optional (defaults to the puppeteer cache).
#        Endpoints/containers are env-overridable with the live defaults of
#        scripts/sahoshi_env.sh (see the block below): *_URL/*_PORT for the
#        services (HYDRO_URL / TWIN_URL for the AI services), DECK_URL /
#        DECK_PORT for the deck, COMPOSE_PROJECT / COMPOSE_FILES /
#        *_CONTAINER for the fleet (DECK_CONTAINER= or EMULATOR_CONTAINER=
#        empty: that service is served outside docker — checked over HTTP
#        only).
#        FLAG_RUN_TIMEOUT_SEC / SWEEP_RUN_TIMEOUT_SEC bound the emulator
#        run polls (C-G runs are asynchronous).
#        SHOWCASE_ALLOW_RECREATE=1 (off by default): when the signal-plan
#        writer is off, recreate the oracle with it on for this run (compose,
#        or ORACLE_WRITER_CMD for a private stack's `docker run`), and with
#        its pre-run value at the end. Off: such a run is refused.
#        SHOWCASE_OUT_DIR: where the artifacts and showcase_results.json
#        land (default showcase/ — the committed evidence; point it
#        elsewhere for any run against a private stack).
#        The deck's operator gate: signed in through scripts/deck_session.sh
#        (PIN from SAHOSHI_OPERATOR_PIN, SAHOSHI_OPERATOR_PIN_FILE or sahoshi.env).
#
# Security: every URL below is an internal endpoint (an env-overridable
# config constant of this script, http scheme, loopback default) — none
# comes from external input, so no host validation is required before
# these requests (the convoy-brain http_guard carve-out for platform
# services).
