"""demo_tour.py — the capability tour's states on the live Sahoshi stack.

Run it through ``scripts/demo_tour.sh`` (which signs in for --apply). Every
capability the console offers has a catalogue entry here: the screen it is seen
on, what must be on the board for it to show, a GET-only check for that state
and, where the state has to be staged, the seed that stages it.

    demo_tour.sh list                              the catalogue (no network)
    demo_tour.sh status [cap ...]                  GET-only: is each state on the board now?
    demo_tour.sh seed <cap|all> ...                dry-run (default): the plan, GET-only
    demo_tour.sh --apply --officer '<name>' seed <cap|all> ...
                                                   stage it, as that named officer
    demo_tour.sh [--apply --officer '<name>'] reset
                                                   stop the emulator runs THIS tour started

Rules it keeps (the same as scripts/demo_reset.sh):

* It never decides anything a human must decide: no approval, rejection,
  dismissal, dispatch, earmark, promotion, escort start or signal write. A
  seed stops at PENDING; the named officer acts on camera.
* A dry-run is GET-only by construction: any other method raises before a byte
  is sent.
* Writes go THROUGH THE DECK as the signed-in officer (the deck sets the
  verified officer header); the backend services are only read.
* Seeds are idempotent: a use case that is already running is kept, not
  started again; a decision-support case the oracle already holds for the same
  inputs is returned by the oracle, not recomputed.
* ``reset`` stops only the runs recorded in this tour's state file. The
  evening (Durga Puja night, cloudburst at high tide, the stolen-vehicle sweep)
  belongs to scripts/demo_reset.sh, which this tour calls for the ``evening``
  seed and never undoes. demo_reset.sh stops every other emulator run, so the
  tour calls it only when the evening is not already running, and before its
  own starts.
