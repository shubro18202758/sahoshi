# demo_tour.sh — the capability tour's states on the live Sahoshi stack.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/demo_tour.sh list                                  the catalogue (no network)
#   bash scripts/demo_tour.sh status [cap ...]                      GET-only: what is on the board now
#   bash scripts/demo_tour.sh seed <cap|all> ...                    dry-run (default): the plan, GET-only
#   bash scripts/demo_tour.sh --apply --officer '<name>' seed <cap|all> ...
#                                                                   stage it, as that named officer
#   bash scripts/demo_tour.sh [--apply --officer '<name>'] reset    stop the runs THIS tour started
#
# Order on the day: scripts/demo_reset.sh --apply first (the evening: Durga Puja night, the cloudburst
# at high tide, the stolen-vehicle sweep), then demo_tour.sh seed <cap> for the rest. demo_reset.sh
# stops other emulator runs, so a later reset clears the tour's runs too.
#
# --apply signs in through scripts/deck_session.sh as --officer (every write is recorded under that
# name); it never approves, rejects, dispatches, earmarks, promotes, starts an escort or writes a
# signal plan: those are the named officer's presses on camera. The logic is scripts/demo_tour.py.
# The PIN and the session cookie are never printed.
