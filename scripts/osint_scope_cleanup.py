"""osint_scope_cleanup.py — retire stored OSINT situations that are out of scope.

The oracle's ingest refuses person-crime, group-conflict and political items since the scope gate
(``osint_common.scope``; ``traffic_oracle.osint.ingest``) and leaves stored ones out of every re-fusion,
so a situation of the last 72 h is withdrawn on the next ingest cycle by itself. Older situations, and
any surfaced before the rule, stay surfaced until this script retires them.

    python3 scripts/osint_scope_cleanup.py            dry-run (default): SELECT only; prints counts and ids
    python3 scripts/osint_scope_cleanup.py --apply    retires them (one UPDATE, one transaction)

A situation is out of scope when its class or a correlated class is ``reported_crime``, ``public_conflict``
or ``unrest``, or when its label or summary reads as crime, conflict or politics (the same cue lists as the
gate). A procession or gathering whose stored summary carries political terms is retired too
(``political_terms``): if its signals are still inside the 72 h window, the next re-fusion writes it again
with those terms withheld.

Retiring is the store's own withdrawal: ``is_event = FALSE`` and ``held_reason = 'withdrawn: out of scope
(<reason>)'`` (a withdrawn situation counts in no held bucket). No row is deleted; the raw signals, the
sources and the audit stay. A corridor event an officer promoted from such a situation is never touched:
it is listed for the officer to review (closing it is a human decision).

Never prints a label, a summary or any other text: ids, classes and reasons only.
