                    situations (their toponym or a member's)

Every query runs on ONE connection, batched per kind (no per-row
queries; the unit projection caches its graph paths), so the snapshot
stays well under the 150 ms poll budget.  A kind whose source fails is
reported in ``feeds[kind].status`` and the rest of the picture still
renders — degradation is visible, never a blank 500.

Entities without a known position are not emitted (they are counted in
``feeds[kind].unlocated``): every snapshot entity has lon/lat.

OSINT (contract C-T, C-C extension; plan X13): an ``osint_event``'s props
are the C-T ``OsintEventRow`` fields (``dss`` included) plus the C-Q
``provenance`` block and ``context_members`` (the store's count of its
CONTEXT members — the feed's subquery); a held situation is never an
entity — the snapshot counts the held situations whose sources are only
social as ``feeds.osint_event.held_social`` (``Snapshot.feed_extra``; there
is no ``feeds.osint`` key: the feeds stay keyed by entity kind).  An ``event``
entity gains ``props.dss`` when a decision support exists for it: the
C-T ``DssSummary`` of the latest ``decision.decision_support`` row, its
``state`` read with C-U's lazy-expiry rule (a stored ``proposed`` past
``expires_at`` reads ``expired``) — the snapshot never writes that state.
Every ``osint.*`` and ``decision.*`` read is guarded by the cached
relation probe, so an unmigrated database serves the pre-OSINT snapshot
unchanged (no OSINT entity, no ``dss``, no extra statement).

The 24-hour rule reads ``created_at``, which is when the situation was
FIRST fused — possibly while it was still held — not when it surfaced (021
records no surfacing time).  A situation that surfaces late through
reports that are themselves older than 24 h (a backfill) therefore stays
off the picture; it is still listed by GET /osint/events and opens in the
dossier.  (A ``surfaced_at`` column is requested for a later migration.)

Defence in depth: the OSINT package registers the canonical model checks
(:func:`register_model_check`; ``traffic_oracle.osint.store`` does it on
import — the city core never imports ``osint_*`` itself, X20).  A stored
row whose props fail ``OsintEventRow`` is never an entity (nor are its
places), and a ``props.dss`` that fails ``DssSummary`` is dropped — the
situation or event keeps its place on the picture without it.
