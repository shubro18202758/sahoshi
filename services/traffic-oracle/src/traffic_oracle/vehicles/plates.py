"""Server-side registration-plate normalization (vehicles only — C6).

Every plate that enters the oracle — an earmark request's path parameter,
an ANPR read's body — goes through :func:`normalize_plate` BEFORE it
touches SQL, so 'WB 06 EM 9001', 'wb-06-em-9001' and 'WB06EM9001' all
resolve to the ONE corridor.vehicles row the ANPR plane writes (the
table's UNIQUE(plate) can no longer fork a vehicle on formatting).

Accepted shapes (after upper-casing and stripping spaces, hyphens, dots):
    * standard series  SS RR [AAA] NNNN — state code, 1-2 digit RTO code,
      0-3 letter series, 1-4 digit number   e.g. WB06EM9001, DL3CAB1234
    * Bharat (BH)      YY BH NNNN AA        e.g. 22BH1234AA

Anything else is refused (ValueError -> HTTP 422): the watchlist never
holds free text that merely looks like a plate.
