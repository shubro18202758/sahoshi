"""OSINT store — every read and write of the ``osint`` schema (migration 021) behind the oracle's
OSINT surfaces (contract C-T).  Places and situations, never persons.

Writes (one ingest transaction, ``ingest.py``):

* ``osint.raw_signals`` — one row per accepted signal, ``ON CONFLICT (signal_id) DO NOTHING`` (a
  duplicate is counted, never overwritten).  The row is the signal AFTER the trust boundary: tier,
  label, prior, licence and redistributability come from ``SOURCE_PRIORS``; a news- or social-tier
  signal is stored with ``url`` and ``raw_geo_hint.polygon_url`` NULL (its raw URL can name a person
  in its slug — orchestrator decision), and a URL-shaped ``source_id`` of those tiers is stored as
  ``sha256:<hex>`` of the URL (the signal id, ``sha1(source:source_id)``, still lets an auditor verify
  a candidate URL);
* ``osint.resolved_events`` — upserted by ``fused_event_id`` (stable across re-fusion), so a
  situation keeps its ``osint_event_id`` while corroboration arrives; a situation absorbed by another
  gets ``superseded_by`` (and passes its promotion on, read from the absorbed row as it stands after
  the supersede, so a promotion that committed mid-ingest is never lost); one whose members no longer
  resolve at all is withdrawn (held, reason ``withdrawn: ...``, never counted as a held kind).
  ABSORPTION IS READ FROM MEMBER OVERLAP, never from an id carried over: a current situation that
  this re-fusion did not write again is absorbed by the situation now holding most of its IDENTITY
  members (OS-4's rule: its point-level members, or every member of a district-only situation — an
  area alert attached as context never decides where a street situation went), so a district-only
  situation whose alert joins a point situation in a later cycle is superseded by THAT point
  situation; a point-level situation is never absorbed by a coarser, district-only one (it is
  withdrawn instead, and its promotion stays where it was); ties go to the situation holding its
  primary member;
  a situation NEVER corroborates the corridor event promoted from it (or from a situation it
  absorbed): such an attach is stored novel (:data:`_SQL_CLEAR_SELF_ATTACH`);
* ``osint.event_sources`` and ``osint.geocodes`` — replaced for every signal of the re-fused window.
  A source keeps the role the pipeline gave it: ``primary``, ``corroborating`` or ``context`` (a
  district-level member attached to a point situation: context, never corroboration — migration 023;
  on a store without 023 it is written ``corroborating``, as before, and still listed last).

The re-fusion window (:func:`load_window`) is built from whole UNITS — a free signal, or a current
situation with every one of its members — and capped at :data:`WINDOW_LIMIT` signals: a unit that
does not fit is left out whole (its rows untouched, counted as truncated), so a situation is never
re-fused half-seen.

Reads (``router.py``, ``promote.py``, and OS-6 through :func:`get_event` / :func:`get_sources`): the
surfaced list with its filters, the held counts, one situation (any state, or surfaced only), its
sources and geocodes.  An OsintEventRow is always a SURFACED situation (the model enforces it); a row
that fails the model is skipped and logged by id, never served.

The gazetteer (``osint.gazetteer``) is synced once per process from ``osint_geo.gazetteer.load()``: an
idempotent upsert by ``gaz_id``; a ``segment_id`` / ``junction_id`` that is not in
``corridor.road_segments`` / ``corridor.junctions`` is stored NULL and logged.
