"""Promote a reported OSINT situation to a corridor event — HUMAN-GATED (contract C-T, plan §5.1).

``POST /api/v1/osint/events/{osint_event_id}/promote`` {officer?, note?, event_kind?} + ``x-sahoshi-officer``.
The AI or a rule proposes; a NAMED officer decides.  Order of checks (frozen; LG 25 and OS-6 rely on it):

1. the body's shape → 422 (FastAPI; an ``event_kind`` of ``crime_incident`` or ``vehicle_pursuit`` is a
   shape error: OSINT never emits either);
2. a named officer — the loopback-verified ``x-sahoshi-officer`` header, else the body ``officer`` —
   otherwise **409 officer-required, before any lookup** (even for an unknown or malformed id);
3. the situation → 404 when unknown;
4. 409 ``not-an-event`` (held or superseded) → 409 ``already-promoted`` (+ ``event_id``) → 409
   ``no-anchor`` (no ``segment_id`` and no segment entering its junction).

Then, with the situation's row locked (concurrent promotions serialise): a ``CorridorEventRequest``
(kind = the situation's ``sahoshi_event_kind`` or the officer's override; title = its label; ONE route
spine ``[segment_id]``; ``metadata {source: "osint", osint_event_id}``; ``source_kind`` 'osint', its
credibility and verification state KEPT as they are — never upgraded; the C-T provenance; the
representative point as ``geotag``) goes through ``events.create_event`` with
``request.state.osint_promotion`` set (the ONLY way an osint event is created — a direct POST /events
stays a 422), then the lifecycle (C-F) moves it to ``active`` with the same officer — the ledger row
names the officer — and ``promoted_event_id`` is recorded.  A live corridor event already created for
the situation but never recorded (a crash between the steps) is adopted, never duplicated.

:func:`promote_osint_event` is the callable OS-6's decision approve reuses (C-U step 1): it returns
the 201 body and raises :class:`PromoteRefused` for the 409s.  A promotion holds one pooled
connection (the row lock) while ``create_event`` and the lifecycle each take one more from the same
pool, so at most :data:`MAX_CONCURRENT_PROMOTIONS` run at once per app (the oracle process has one) —
promotions can never drain the pool and deadlock on acquire.  A caller must not hold a pooled connection of its own
while it awaits :func:`promote_osint_event`.
