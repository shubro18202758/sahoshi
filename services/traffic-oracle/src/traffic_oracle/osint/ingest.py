"""OSINT ingest — ``POST /api/v1/osint/signals`` behind the oracle's trust boundary (contract C-T).

One batch (1..200 signals, already redacted at parse by osint-ingress) is screened signal by signal,
stored, and the recent window is RE-FUSED server-side through the OSINT libraries — all in ONE
serialised transaction:

1. **Screen** every signal: no person key at any depth (``ethics.assert_no_person_keys``), the
   canonical model (``RawOsintSignal``, ``extra="forbid"``), and the surviving-PII check again
   (``ethics.find_pii`` on the title and the text).  A failing signal is ``rejected`` with its reason
   (``forbidden_key`` | ``pii_unredacted`` | ``invalid``) and is NEVER stored; its id is echoed only
   when it is a well-formed signal id, and no text of it is ever logged.
2. **Trust boundary (plan R26)**: the payload's ``source_tier``, ``provenance_label``,
   ``credibility_prior``, ``license`` and ``redistributable`` are never trusted — they are re-derived
   from ``osint_common.kinds.SOURCE_PRIORS[signal.source]`` before anything is stored or fused, so a
   caller can never mint an "Official, verified" situation by labelling a signal so.  The one
   exception only ever LOWERS trust: a signal that declares itself ``EMULATED`` or ``SIMULATED``
   keeps that label (synthetic data stays labelled synthetic).  Signals whose payload disagreed are
   counted (the ``osint.ingest.counts`` log line and ``trust_boundary`` in the reply; no text).
   A news- or social-tier signal is stored without its raw URL (orchestrator decision: URL slugs can
   name a person; the publisher and the signal id stay) — counted as ``urls_withheld``.  A poster
   handle that slipped through parse is stripped from the title and the text before anything is
   stored or fused (ethics rule 2, defence in depth: ``osint_analysis.classify.strip_handles``, the
   pipeline's own helper — the ``submitted by …`` trailer goes, any other ``/u/<name>`` becomes
   ``[PERSON]``) — counted as ``account_refs_stripped``.
2b. **Scope (events are about places and road situations)**: a signal that reports a person-crime, a clash
   between groups or a political item (``osint_common.scope``: the wording, then the classifier's class —
   ``reported_crime``, ``public_conflict`` and ``unrest`` are out of scope) is ``rejected`` with
   ``out_of_scope_crime`` | ``out_of_scope_conflict`` | ``out_of_scope_political`` and is NEVER stored; a
   procession or gathering on a road is kept with its political terms withheld (``[WITHHELD]``).  The
   re-fused window is screened the same way (a signal stored before the rule is left out of re-fusion, so
   its situation is withdrawn), and a situation the pipeline still places in an out-of-scope class (the
   zero-shot fallback) is not written.  Counted in ``scope`` in the reply and the ``osint.ingest.counts``
   log line; no text.
3. **Store** ``osint.raw_signals`` (``ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING``: a repeat is counted in
   ``duplicates``), then **re-fuse** the window — this batch, every signal stored in the last 72 h,
   every signal published within 72 h of the batch's reports (so a replay or backfill of cached
   signals corroborates across batches too), each with every member of its current situation;
   ≤ 2 000 signals in WHOLE units (``store.load_window``: a situation that does not fit is left out
   untouched, never re-fused half-seen; counted as ``window.truncated``) — with
   ``run_pipeline(..., live=live_state.snapshot(conn, valkey=...))`` — the live corridor state,
   convoys in motion, 108 routes and closures the second-order flags read — and write the
   situations, sources and geocodes (``store.persist_result``: ``osint_event_id`` stays stable per
   ``fused_event_id``; an absorbed situation gets ``superseded_by``; a situation never
   corroborates the corridor event promoted from it — that attach is stored novel and not counted
   in ``attached_to_live``).

The pipeline is ``osint_analysis.pipeline.run_pipeline`` with an
``osint_geo.resolver.GazetteerResolver``, imported lazily by :func:`get_pipeline` — a FastAPI
dependency, so tests override it
(``app.dependency_overrides[get_pipeline]``) or set :data:`PIPELINE_HOOK`.  Without the libraries the
route answers 503 "osint pipeline not deployed" and stores nothing.
