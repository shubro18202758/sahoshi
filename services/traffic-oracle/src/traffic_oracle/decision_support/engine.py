"""The decision-support engine (C-U): frame → COAs → wargame → feasibility → veto → MCDA → EVOI → dissent.

One :class:`Frame` per subject (an ``osint_event`` situation or a corridor ``event``) becomes one
``DecisionSupport`` document, validated against ``osint_common.types.DecisionSupport`` before it leaves:

1. **frame** — the situation with its credibility, verification state, geocode confidence, attach and
   second-order flags (``frame_from_osint`` / ``frame_from_event``; ``frame_from_poc`` reads the PoC's
   ``dss_input`` shape for fixtures and parity);
2. **COAs** from real actuators (``coa.build_coas``), an area-level subject's road-anchored ones infeasible up
   front;
3. **wargame** — ``twin+cascade`` when the twin and the road graph answer, else the seeded ``surrogate``
   (``wargame.py``); every run is a ``decision.coa_sim_runs`` row;
4. **feasibility** against the live unit plane (``feasibility.py``);
5. **lexical veto before scoring**, then **TOPSIS** with **AHP** weights (CR reported), zero-variance criteria
   dropped and reported as gate-passed, **Dirichlet sensitivity** (``mcda.py``); the **public-safety floor**
   (FIX-C) holds the do-nothing baseline below every feasible response COA when people are reported hurt or
   public safety is at stake and the report is credible enough to act on — below the threshold the rationale says
   verify first;
6. **EVOI** (``voi.py``), a recommendation and an explicit **dissent** (``dissent.py``); the resource-blocked
   best response (the highest-scoring COA that cannot be resourced and outscores the pick — a held baseline is
   never it) is named with what is missing and the request-units action — surfaced, never buried, and the floor's
   mode is carried as ``recommendation.public_safety_floor``;
7. the **composite confidence** — an honest blend of credibility, score spread and geocode confidence, labelled
   as a blend, not calibrated.

The engine writes nothing (``store.py`` persists the 022 rows); it never proposes an action against a person, and
every actuating action waits for a named officer.  The brain's optional ``strategy_prior`` is recorded in
``recommendation.strategy_prior`` and ``provenance.model_tiers`` and never changes the MCDA.
