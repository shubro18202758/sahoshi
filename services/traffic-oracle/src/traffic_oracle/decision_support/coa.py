"""Course-of-action generation (C-U): a small, distinct COA set from REAL Sahoshi actuators.

Every event gets the same five strategies (GEOSPATIAL_AND_DSS §B1-2, the PoC's ``build_coas``):

* ``coa_base`` — **baseline**: monitor only (the mandatory do-nothing option);
* ``coa_min`` — **minimal**: a driver and citizen advisory (draft only);
* ``coa_std`` — **standard**: advisory + a 108 dispatch (when the situation calls for one) + one responder
  dispatch + an emergency signal-priority hold;
* ``coa_agg`` — **aggressive**: closure + diversion + the dispatches (two responder units);
* ``coa_info`` — **information**: one patrol to verify + a situation check by the city's ICCC (outside Sahoshi,
  **no identification**) + a 10-minute hold.

The responder and the 108 follow the situation (a declared deviation from the WP's literal "108 dispatch + police
dispatch", which is the PoC's road-collision case and which this reproduces exactly): the responder agency is the one
the class calls for (:data:`_RESPONDER`: a fire tender for a fire, hazard or infrastructure failure; a traffic
police unit for flooding, weather, a closure, a work zone or an egress surge; police otherwise), and the 108 is
included when a report carries an injury cue or the class is one where casualties are likely
(:data:`_AMBULANCE_CLASSES`).  The verifying patrol of the information COA is always police.

Targets are real URNs (``segment:<id>``, ``junction:<id>``, ``place:<slug>``). Every actuating action
(``signal_hold``, ``diversion``, ``dispatch``, ``escort_switch``, ``closure``) has ``requires_officer: true``.
A COA that touches a person is impossible by construction: no verb acts on a person, no target names one, and
the ICCC check is a situation check only (``identification: false``). :func:`assess_ethics` and the lexical veto
check it anyway.

An **area-level** subject (no segment and no junction: a district report) cannot anchor a dispatch, closure,
diversion or signal hold: those COAs are marked infeasible up front ("no road anchor: area-level report") and the
information COA becomes an ICCC check plus a hold for an official source, so it stays feasible.

Each COA also carries its DSS-layer **effect profile** (the PoC's ``sim``): how much carriageway it takes, how
long the disturbance lasts, how fast it acts — the per-COA event injection the twin cannot express.
