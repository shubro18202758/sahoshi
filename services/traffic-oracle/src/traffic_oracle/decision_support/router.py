"""Decision-support routes (contract C-U) — mounted by ``coordination.py``'s guarded mount when this imports.

    POST /api/v1/decision-support/{event_urn}/generate   compute-only (R2 allow-list), no officer
         {horizon_min?: 15..120 (45), seed?, strategy_prior?, requested_by?: deck|brain}
         → 201 a new DecisionSupport (it supersedes the subject's previous proposal)
         → 200 the existing proposal of the same subject and input fingerprint, < 10 minutes old
         → 404 unknown or held subject; 409 "event-closed"; 503 not deployed / not migrated
    GET  /api/v1/decision-support/{dss_id}               → DecisionSupport (lazily ``expired``); 404 unknown
    POST /api/v1/decision-support/{dss_id}/decision      HUMAN-GATED: a named officer decides
         {decision: approve|reject|defer, coa_id?, note?, officer} + x-sahoshi-officer
         → 200 {dss_id, state, coa_id, officer, decided_at, promoted_event_id, dispatch_ids[], next_steps[]}

The decision's order of checks is FROZEN (C-U; LG 25 relies on it):

1. the body's shape → 422 (FastAPI; approve names a ``coa_id``, reject and defer carry a note);
2. a named officer — the loopback-verified ``x-sahoshi-officer``, else the body ``officer`` — otherwise
   **409 officer-required, before any lookup**: an unknown or malformed ``dss_id`` without an officer is also
   409 officer-required;
3. the DSS row → 404 when the ``dss_id`` is unknown;
4. the state → 409 ``not-proposed`` (an expired DSS is not proposed: the lazy expiry is applied first);
5. approve: the COA → 409 ``unknown-coa`` | ``coa-vetoed`` | ``coa-infeasible``, then ``no-anchor``.

Approve is an ordered, idempotent sequence: (1) an unpromoted ``osint_event`` whose COA has a dispatch, closure,
diversion or signal-hold action is promoted with the same officer through OS-5's ``promote_osint_event``
(``already-promoted`` reuses the event; no pooled connection of ours is held while it runs); (2) in ONE
transaction holding the DSS row lock: one dispatch REQUEST per dispatch action (each then decided on its own),
the DSS → ``approved`` and one ``decision.dss_decision_log`` row.  A failure in (2) leaves the DSS proposed; a
retry reuses the promoted event and duplicates nothing.  Every other verb writes nothing and comes back in
``next_steps`` with its home.  Reject and defer write the state and a log row only.

The engine proposes; a named officer decides.  No route here acts on a person.
