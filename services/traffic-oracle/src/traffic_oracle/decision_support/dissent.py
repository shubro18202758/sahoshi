"""Recommendation dissent (C-U): not just the winner — why not the runner-up, and what single change would flip it.

Every clause is computed, never boilerplate:

* **why not the runner-up** — the closeness gap, the rank stability, and the heavily weighted criteria on which
  the recommended COA beats it — a lead on a fixed prior (the per-action safety table, the nominal time to effect:
  ``mcda.FIXED_PRIORS``) is said to be one and never claimed as a simulated advantage (HON-7, HON-8); when the
  runner-up is the do-nothing baseline held down by the public-safety
  floor, the clause says that instead of claiming a scoring win, and no closeness gap to the held baseline is
  claimed (the margin is never negative because of the hold);
* **the best blocked response** (FIX-C) — when the highest-scoring course of action that units could unblock
  outscores the pick, it is named with its closeness, what is actually short (from its own required and free
  units — "a patrol is free, but no 108 ambulance is free", never a blanket "none is on duty") and the
  plain-language action ("request units"), never buried behind a do-nothing recommendation;
* **the public-safety floor** (FIX-C) — when it holds, the sentence says the do-nothing baseline is held below
  every feasible response COA with the credibility the floor acted on; below the act-on-it threshold the
  rationale says verify first and points at the information COA (and names what is missing when the information
  COA cannot be resourced);
* **what would flip it**, each checked against the actual model:
  - *more units*: an infeasible COA whose TOPSIS closeness beats the pick would win once resourced (its shortfall
    is the change); one that would still lose is said to.  A COA blocked because an area-level report has no road
    ("no road anchor") is NOT a resourcing question: the change it needs is a road-level location for the report
    (a segment or a junction) and a regeneration, and its closeness on the notional arterial decides nothing;
  - *a reweighting*: the smallest single-criterion weight increase (×1.25 … ×8) under which the runner-up
    overtakes the pick, or that none does — never offered for a baseline the floor holds down (no weight can put
    it first: the floor is non-compensatory) or for a runner-up that cannot be resourced;
  - *an official source*: the value of information re-evaluated at official-grade credibility (0.95) and the
    credibility below which the engine would advise verifying first — for a reported situation, and for a
    corridor event a named officer promoted from one;
* **the honest corroboration sentence of the PoC** — how many independent publishers and source tiers stand
  behind the report, and that its credibility is not inflated past its verification state.  A corridor event
  promoted from OSINT carries its report's corroboration; an emulator event says EMULATED; only a live event
  opened on the city's own channel says that no OSINT corroboration is involved;
* **context, never corroboration** — a district-level source attached to a point report (source role
  ``context``) is named as "District warning in effect (<publisher>)" for an official one, else "District-level
  report in effect", and is not counted as corroboration, as a publisher or in the credibility;
* the infeasible aggressive option's note (ranked last and labelled — ``INFEASIBLE`` when no road anchor blocks
  it, ``RESOURCE-INFEASIBLE`` for units — with its 108 and cascade effects when the wargame shows them, said to be
  on a notional arterial for an area-level report);
* the second-order flags, each with what the wargame actually did with it: a live 108 route is fed to the
  cascade's 108 delay and a live closure with a segment is kept out of the reassignment (``twin+cascade`` only),
  its clearance named as a change only when it lies on an alternative the reassignment would otherwise use;
  everything else is "listed, not modelled";
* the brain's strategy prior when it disagrees — recorded, never scored.
