"""R_SIGNAL_VIOLATION speaks the vocabulary the signal programs define.

Pure python, no DB.  The programs are the REAL 006 phase JSON (parsed out
of corridor-store/migrations/006_simulation_runs.sql) and the junction
approach geometry is the REAL seed network (parsed out of
corridor-store/seed/sample_corridor.sql), so these tests break the moment
either drifts from what the rules assume.

The bug this pins: the rules mapped headings onto compass codes NS/EW while
every seeded program lists through/cross/ramp/local, and a movement absent
from every phase was evaluated as red — R_SIGNAL_VIOLATION fired on every
read of a full-cycle sweep at a signalised junction.  The cases below are
Kolkata's OSM-signalised junctions (Park Street crossing J12, Ultadanga J33).
