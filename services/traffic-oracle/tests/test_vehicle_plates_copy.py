"""The 422 refusal copy of plate normalisation (FIX-E-LOOKUP, audit A).

``normalize_plate``'s :class:`InvalidPlate` messages used to ECHO the raw
input and name a FULL mark (``expected e.g. WB06EM9001`` — the demo's
stolen plate).  The lookup route's 422 already went through
``LOOKUP_INVALID_PLATE_DETAIL`` (no echo, no full mark) because a
near-mark is a mark in all but one character: an error that quotes the
input or an example lets a caller search the space (the audit's
hash-reversal demo recovered the plate in 0.47 ms after 901 tries).

This file pins, for BOTH raises (the too-long/empty guard and the
pattern guard — the earmark route shows them verbatim via ``str(exc)``):

* the message names the FORMAT in words (state code, district number,
  optional series, 4-digit number, BH series) — a caller can fix the
  input without seeing any plate;
* the message never echoes the input and never carries a full mark —
  nothing that ``normalize_plate`` itself would accept, in any
  spelling;
* the message is input-INDEPENDENT: the same sentence for junk, for a
  near-mark and for a date phrase (no per-input detail to mine);
* normalisation itself is unchanged (the accepted/refused sets).

Fails on the pre-change code: the old messages quoted ``{raw!r}`` and
the example marks.  Pure, hermetic, no DB.
