"""The OSINT scope gate at the oracle's trust boundary (osint_common.scope, traffic_oracle.osint.ingest).

Events are about places and road situations: a person-crime report, a clash between groups and a political item
are rejected (``out_of_scope_*``) and never stored; a procession or gathering on a road is kept with its political
terms withheld; a stored signal from before the rule is left out of re-fusion. English, Bengali and Hindi
headlines, all synthetic. This module runs with the gate ON (it never sets ``SCOPE_GATE_OFF``).
