"""Living City — the always-on, deterministic ambient Kolkata.

Runs when ``EMULATOR_LIVING_CITY=1`` (or when an operator starts it from
the deck).  Kolkata is never empty at rest: at any instant two to three
emulated causes hold a stretch of road, two Kolkata Traffic Police beats
ride their patrol routes, the registered ANPR cameras read passing traffic,
and every ~25 minutes an ambulance (108) asks for a green corridor — which
only a named duty officer can approve.

DENSITY.  ``EMULATOR_LIVING_DENSITY`` (``DENSITY_LEVELS``) makes the same
city busier, never different in kind: at 2, eighteen emulated field units
ride (eleven Kolkata Traffic Police beats, three Kolkata Police PCR beats
and four ambulance (108) standby circuits, each on a connected chain of
the city network's own two-way roads, beside the first two beats), two more
intermittent cause lanes run (mostly three to five causes at once), a 108
request comes every ~15 minutes and a deliberate violator every ~12; at 3,
four more lanes (mostly four to seven causes), a 108 request every ~11
minutes and a violator every ~10.  Every unit, cause and read stays labelled emulated; the levels
are MODELLED choices for a legible picture, not a statistic of the city.
At 1 (the default) the program is exactly the baseline one.

THE CITY'S RHYTHM.  What happens when follows Kolkata's day and year (see
``_kind_weights``; every weight is a MODELLED assumption, not a statistic):
the office peaks into and out of BBD Bag–Esplanade and Sector V (about
09:30–11:30 and 17:30–20:00 on working days), the Sector V and New Town IT
shift changes (morning, evening and the late-evening night-shift change),
school runs, morning bazaars and evening shopping strips, goods vehicles on
the arterials at night, waterlogging in the monsoon (June to September),
worse while the Hooghly is at high water (the outfalls close; the tide
phase is a MODELLED M2 cycle, city.tide_index), Nor'wester squalls on April
and May evenings, and Durga Puja nights (Saptami to Navami, 18:00–04:00)
when crowds peak around the pandals.  Every site is a Kolkata road or
crossing from the city pack (landmarks.json ids and spellings), named in
English and Bengali.

DETERMINISM.  The day program is a pure function f(city_seed, IST date):
~40 slots on three lanes (two always on, one intermittent — hence 2–3
overlapping causes), the 108 requests and the rare deliberate violators.
The same date and seed give the identical program on any host.  The
background trickle is a pure function of (day seed, tick index); the only
runtime input it consults is the signal phase the oracle itself would
evaluate (the same pure clock, tape.movement_states_at), so law-abiding
traffic crosses stop lines on green.

CAUSES ONLY.  A slot becomes a corridor event (metadata source
'event-emulator', mode 'living_city', slot, run_id) opened 'active' and
closed 'completed' through the oracle's lifecycle seam (C-F).  Reads go
through the oracle's ANPR seam (C-E): the oracle computes hits from its
earmarks and e-challan rules from its limits and programs — the living
city never asserts either; deliberate violators are causes (a vehicle that
speeds, one that runs a red), and the outcome is checked against the plan:
an UNPLANNED rule hit is counted and its camera leaves the compliant
rotation.  108 requests land as dispatch rows in 'requested' — never
approved by the emulator.  Patrols ride corridor.units.emulated (C-A); a
patrol an officer has dispatched is handed to the oracle's dispatch
projection.  Slots write no adaptive:inputs docs: the situation engine
reads live traffic for them.

PRE-EMPTION.  A manual or flagship emulator run holds its route: open slots
on those roads close at once ('pre-empted by run N'), none opens there
until the run ends, and a pre-empted slot whose window is still open then
resumes as a fresh event.

108 REQUESTS OUTLIVE THEIR SLOT.  Closing an event makes the oracle cancel
its open dispatches (its C-F auto-close).  A 108 request still waiting for
an officer when its slot closes — pre-emption, the window's end, the IST
day rollover — is re-filed on the next tick onto a slot that is open, with
a note naming the request it replaces, for up to 20 minutes after 108
first asked; the duty officer's queue never silently loses a pending
request.  (An emulator restart is the exception: the closing process
cannot re-file, so those requests end cancelled with their audit row.)

SELF-HEALING.  An oracle or database outage never leaves the city wrong
for longer than it lasts: an event that could not be activated, or closed,
is retried every ~30 s, and a session that could not be ledgered at start
is ledgered once the store answers.  An event an officer cancelled before
the city could activate it is left closed.

NETWORK CHECK.  The sites and patrol beats name the city network's own
segments and junctions; at the first session the city checks them against
the live network, and a mismatch (a reseeded network) fails loudly — status
detail, /health reason, error log — while slots on unknown roads never
open.

Ethics (C6): vehicles only (plates, no person, face or frame); every plate
carries the EM series marker; every event, unit and read is labelled
emulated.  Events are about places, never people.
