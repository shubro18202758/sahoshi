"""The emulator's network-bound data agrees with the Kolkata city network.

The library routes, the profiles' cause segments and the living city's
sites and beats are written by tools/kolkata_library.py from the city
network; the tests elsewhere run on its slim snapshot.  When the full pack
network (cities/kolkata/network.json, or EMULATOR_CITY_NETWORK) is present,
these tests rebuild everything from it and fail on any drift — a
regenerated network then needs one re-run of the tool.  They skip in a tree
without the pack network.
