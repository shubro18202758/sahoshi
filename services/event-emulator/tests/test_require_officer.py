"""The emulator keeps working when the oracle requires a named officer — no network.

infra/compose.argus-override.yml passes VVIP_REQUIRE_OFFICER (default 1) to the
traffic-oracle as well as the brain (F-CONN-02). With it on, the oracle answers
422 to an earmark create (vehicles/__init__.py) whose ``earmarked_by`` is
missing, and to a write whose actor fails its named-actor rule
(city/common.py named_actor: whitespace collapsed, 2..max characters, no
control or bidi character; max 120 for earmarks, 64 for the other writes).

The emulator's only officer-gated oracle write is the scenario-precondition
earmark of the Stolen-Vehicle ANPR Sweep, and it always names its system
actor in the body — never an x-sahoshi-officer header, which only the deck sets
from a verified operator session. This pins both, against a MockTransport
oracle that enforces the rule exactly as VVIP_REQUIRE_OFFICER=1 does.
