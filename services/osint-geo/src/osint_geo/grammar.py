"""The regex place grammar (OSINT SPEC §1.4 step 2; research A4): candidate place spans the dictionary scan misses.

Three span kinds, read from the text as given (:func:`find_spans`):

* **relational** — a cue then a capitalised name: "near Ruby Hospital", "opp. New Market", "outside Sealdah";
* **feature** — one to three words then a place word: "Gariahat more", "Ultadanga flyover", "Bijon setu",
  "Park St", "AJC Bose Rd"; Bengali and Hindi place words too ("রুবি মোড়", "গড়িয়াহাট মোড়");
* **pin** — a Kolkata PIN code, ``700\\d\\d\\d`` (written "700 019" too).

A span never crosses a clause boundary (``, ; : ! ? ( ) [ ] |`` or a sentence stop). Each carries normalised lookup
``keys``, most specific first: for a feature span every head length (three words down to one) with the place word
as written and rewritten to the gazetteer's own generic ("more" → "crossing", "setu" → "bridge", "rd" → "road"),
a Bengali or Hindi head also transliterated (:func:`osint_geo.translit.to_latin`).

How the resolver uses them: :func:`feature_hits` applies the same rewrite on the token list against the gazetteer
index, so "gariahat more" resolves to the one junction, Gariahat crossing, and not to the bare "gariahat" (which
names the neighbourhood); relational and feature keys are the first candidates of the fuzzy stage (multi-word
only); a PIN is evidence that the text is about Kolkata (source locality), never a location by itself — no PIN to
area table is committed, and the resolver does not guess one.
