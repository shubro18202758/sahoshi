"""The geo-resolver (OSINT SPEC §1.4; research A2–A8): a :class:`RawOsintSignal` → a :class:`Geocode`, or ``None``.

:class:`GazetteerResolver` implements ``osint_common.pipeline.GeoResolver``. Offline and deterministic: it reads the
gazetteer and the network once and calls nothing else. For one signal (its title, its text and the connector's
place-name hints, read together in the PoC's order):

1. **Extract** (:meth:`GazetteerResolver.mentions`): the gazetteer's longest-match scan, plus the place grammar's
   rewrites of generic words ("Gariahat more" → Gariahat crossing). Every non-overlapping occurrence is a
   mention. The text is the title, the text and the first :data:`MAX_HINTS` geo hints (:data:`MAX_HINT_CHARS`
   characters each: connectors send one to three short names). No form, rewrite or fuzzy window spans a sentence
   end (:meth:`GazetteerResolver.tokens`): "Fire at Gariahat. More details awaited" names the neighbourhood, never
   "Gariahat more", the crossing; nor is "more than" a crossing ("Gariahat more than knee deep").
2. **Candidates**: each mention reads as every place its form names (exact alias, match 1.0). Only when nothing
   matches exactly, fuzzy matching (``difflib`` ratio ≥ 0.90, trigram-prefiltered): first the grammar's cue-bound
   names ("near Ruby Hopsital"), then three-word and then two-word windows; every occurrence of a matching name is
   a mention, so a misspelt place never reads as surer than the same place spelt right. **Stoplist guard** (the
   PoC's "India" ↔ "indira" fix): fuzzy matching is multi-word only (a window of at least two words and eight
   characters, against multi-word forms), never on a window holding a locality or newsroom word
   (:data:`FUZZY_STOP`) or made only of generic words (``gazetteer.GENERIC_STOPWORDS``), and no single generic
   word is ever a surface form. **Context gate**: a form that names a Kolkata place only in a text about
   Kolkata (:data:`CONTEXT_FORMS`: a common word, "maidan" (any field) or "bypass"; a name many cities share, "MG
   Road", "Park Street", "Science City", "Medical College", "New Market", "Salt Lake"; and every bare route code,
   "NH-12") is a mention only when the signal is placed in the city: by its own metadata
   (:meth:`GazetteerResolver.city_scoped`: r/kolkata, KMC or Kolkata Police as the source, a geo hint naming
   Kolkata, Howrah or Bidhannagar, a metro district code ``LGD:KOLKATA``/``LGD:HOWRAH``, a Kolkata PIN) or by its
   text naming the city (:data:`CITY_WORDS`). State-level evidence never opens the gate (SACHET or WBSDMA as the
   source, ``LGD:WEST_BENGAL``, ``GDELT_ADM1:IN28``, a hint naming only West Bengal: Siliguri has a Science City
   too). With the gate closed such a form is not read at all, exactly or fuzzily (a window that is a gated form
   never fuzzy-matches a longer one: "medical college hospital" in Patna is not "NRS Medical College Hospital").
   The longer forms that carry the place ("Kolkata Medical College", "EM Bypass", "Park Street police station")
   are never gated. **Another thing of the same name** (:data:`NOT_A_PLACE_BEFORE`): "Howrah Mail" and "Howrah
   Express" are trains, never the city of Howrah. **The state gate** (:data:`STATE_GATED_FORMS`): a signal with
   state-level evidence (:meth:`GazetteerResolver.state_scoped`) and no city-level evidence (the context gate
   closed) does not read the bare "Howrah", "Behala" or "Dum Dum" in any spelling: a state-wide alert names
   districts and towns, not the city's areas. In such a signal "Howrah" is no city word either: an alert listing
   "Howrah, Hooghly and Nadia" names the district, so it cannot open the gate for itself.
3. **Disambiguation**: each reading scores
   ``R = 0.25·in_bbox + 0.15·specificity + 0.20·coherence + 0.10·importance + 0.10·source_locality + 0.10·match``
   (research A6's weights, the embedding-context term left off: the Embedder is OS-4's). Coherence is the share of
   the other readings (at another point) within 8 km. The best R wins; ties go to the longer, then earlier mention.
4. **Snap** (:mod:`osint_geo.snap`): a junction toponym keeps its ``junction_id``, a road its ``segment_id``; a
   landmark attaches to the segment whose anchor is nearest (residual = geodesic metres to that anchor), or with
   no anchor in reach to the nearest road line, but only within 900 m (``confidence.SNAP_ANCHOR_MAX_M``, fusion's
   on-segment limit): farther it has no road anchor and no snap quality. A **neighbourhood is an area** and never
   gets a road anchor (F-HONEST OSINT-3: a bare area word is not a street; it was snapped up to 2.5 km away).
5. **Confidence** (:mod:`osint_geo.confidence`), with the margin between the best and the runner-up reading. Every
   mention is a reading (the PoC's semantics, on which the R23 figures are calibrated): a place named twice ties
   with itself, so the margin term pays out only for a single unambiguous mention; repetition never inflates it.

**Area level** (plan R28), only for an official source or GDELT, and only when no toponym resolved: a metro
district code (``LGD:KOLKATA`` or ``LGD:HOWRAH``, or a GDELT ``ActionGeo_FullName`` naming Kolkata/Calcutta) gives
that district's representative point, ``area_scope "district"``, confidence 0.40; ``LGD:NORTH_24_PARGANAS`` and
``LGD:SOUTH_24_PARGANAS`` (which hold Salt Lake, New Town, Behala and Garia, but also the Sundarbans) give the
district with **no point**, confidence 0.30, once C-T accepts a district geocode without a point
(:data:`DISTRICT_WITHOUT_POINT`; until then such an alert is ``None``, never a point and never an exception: the
contract's district carries its representative point); a state code (``LGD:WEST_BENGAL``, ``GDELT_ADM1:IN28``) gives
``area_scope "state"`` with **no point** (a state-wide alert is not a Kolkata location), confidence 0.25; any other
code gives ``None``. Otherwise the honest ``None``: never a city centroid dressed as precise. A source's tier is
read from ``SOURCE_PRIORS``, never from the payload (plan R26).

Places only: a geocode names a place, never a person; the resolver keeps no signal text.
