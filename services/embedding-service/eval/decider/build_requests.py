"""Build the decider side-by-side request set from the brain's own builders.

SIMULATED: every scenario below is synthetic (Kolkata places from
cities/kolkata/landmarks.json, invented numbers). Nothing here is a real
event, a real movement or a real statistic.

The question sets and state documents come from convoy-brain itself:
  pre_movement        workflows.pre_movement._route_options/_route_questions/_route_state_doc
                      + DeciderBrain.build_state_doc(pre_movement=True)
  tool_selection      DeciderBrain.tool_selection_question(orchestrator._TOOL_MENU)
                      + the orchestrator's operator_chat state document
  dss_coa             dss.coa_generator.dss_questions + the strategy_prior state document
  escort_incident     the live-escort incident question set (INCIDENT_ACTIONS)
  escort_departure    the live-escort departure question set (DEPARTURE_ACTIONS)
  post_clearance      the restoration_posture question (RESTORATION_POSTURES)
  probe               the brain's health probe and the C1 smoke shape (described
                      options, a five-level scale)

Some requests carry an ``expected`` answer (a synthetic label, only where the
operator's request names the tool or the situation leaves one sensible
answer); they score accuracy, the rest score agreement only.

Run from the repo root with an interpreter that has convoy-brain's
dependencies (the gate interpreter, $GATE_PYTHON); convoy-brain/src is put
on sys.path here:
    "$GATE_PYTHON" services/embedding-service/eval/decider/build_requests.py
Writes requests.json next to this file.
