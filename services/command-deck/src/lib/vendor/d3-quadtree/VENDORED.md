## What was copied

Only `package/src/**` (into `src/`) and `package/LICENSE`, byte for byte, with exactly two edits per file:

1. a first line `// @ts-nocheck` (the deck's tsconfig has `checkJs`; upstream ships untyped JavaScript);
2. no import rewrite: the package has no bare import (its files import each other relatively).

Nothing else differs from the tarball. To verify, re-download the tarball, check the sha256 above, and compare each
`src/*.js` with `package/src/*.js` after dropping the first line and undoing the import rewrite.

Typed access for the deck lives in `src/lib/analysis/graph/force.ts`; nothing outside `src/lib/analysis` imports
this folder.
