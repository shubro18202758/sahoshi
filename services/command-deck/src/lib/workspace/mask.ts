/**
 * The workspace's registration-mark mask (C6; SPEC §7.5: every egress path
 * is masked, whether or not an officer is named; §9.3: no raw mark in DOM
 * text without a named officer).
 *
 * plates.ts (S3) mirrors the oracle's rule (city/common.py), which matches a
 * mark as the server writes it: upper case, a space or a dash between the
 * parts. Text an OPERATOR types reaches the workspace's egress paths (a
 * filter label from the omnibar, a saved view's name, a watch's title, a
 * share link) in any case and spelling, and server props can carry a raw
 * mark inside free text (an e-challan's proposal, an earmark reason, a
 * pursuit's title), so this mask is case-insensitive and takes a space, a
 * dash, a dot, a slash or an underscore (up to three) between the parts:
 *
 *   WB06EM9001 · wb06em9001 · Wb 06 Em 9001 · WB-06-EM-9001 · WB.06.EM.9001 · WB/06/EM/9001
 *
 * all keep their state code, RTO number and series and hide the 4-digit
 * number but its last digit (…•••1), as the oracle's mask does.
 *
 * Only a REAL Indian registration mark matches the any-case rule (review r3):
 *   - the state code is one of the Indian state and union-territory codes
 *     (STATE_CODES, any case), never any two letters;
 *   - a date's shape is never a mark: a month in mixed or lower case
 *     ("Oct", "nov"), a separator, then the number — so a date or a time
 *     ("As of 24 Oct 2026", "AS 24 Oct 2026", "on 12 oct 2026", "at 10 am
 *     2026") is never read as one. The case tells them apart (orchestrator,
 *     review r3): marks from the oracle and in operator text are upper
 *     case, prose dates are not. So an UPPER-case state code with an
 *     UPPER-case series is a mark even when the series spells a month
 *     ("WB 01 MAY 1234", "DL 8 SEP 1234", "WB-01-OCT-1234"), and a series
 *     glued to its number is one in any case ("DL8SEP1234", a Delhi
 *     two-wheeler's S-EP series): no date is written either way, and
 *     refusing them would leak a real mark. (An all-caps date after a
 *     state-code word, "AS 24 OCT 2026", therefore reads as a mark: the
 *     ethics rail prefers masking.)
 *
 * After that rule, and over the text it already masked, the oracle's own
 * upper-case pass runs too (FIX-C: one rule everywhere): an UPPER-case
 * mark shape masks whatever its first two letters — "XY12AB1234", because
 * the watchlist's normalize_plate accepts any two letters, so a plate it
 * holds never leaves the oracle raw in a reason or a title — with a space
 * or a dash between the parts, exactly as the oracle (city/common.py,
 * _PLATE_UPPER_RE) always masked it. There is no date-shape refusal on
 * this pass (case-sensitive: prose dates are not upper case; "AS OF 24
 * OCT 2026" masks as it always did), and uuids are held out of it too.
 * Text that holds no mark comes back byte for byte (the same string), so
 * running the mask over an officer's note or a streamed answer alters
 * nothing but a mark (SPEC §3.4: those are never rewritten).
 *
 * Ids are never marks: a UUID (a URN's id) is held out of the mask's reach,
 * so a hex group such as `ab12-3456` is never mistaken for one.
