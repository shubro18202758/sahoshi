/**
 * The AI-surfaces string pack — every string the forecast, waterlogging and signal-timing surfaces print on Home,
 * the Map and Decide. EN here; HI and BN in ./packs.ai.hi.ts and ./packs.ai.bn.ts, complete for every key
 * (tests/ai-ops.unit.mjs and tests/bn-script.unit.mjs check it). Registered additively through registerPack();
 * every key starts with `ai_`.
 *
 * Copy rules (as packs.map3): sentence case, no ALL-CAPS word outside the acronym list, at most one " · " per
 * string, titles ≤ 32 characters. Honest labels say what a number is: live, observed, modelled, emulated,
 * simulated, hindsight. Numbers and times stay in Latin digits in all three languages (the console's rule).
 * A proposal is always a proposal; a named officer decides; if no one decides, the current plan holds.
