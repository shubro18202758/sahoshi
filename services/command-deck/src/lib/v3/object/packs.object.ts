/**
 * The object-page string pack (V3-SPEC §6.3, §6.4, §7.8) — every string /o/<urn> prints, in EN here and HI /
 * BN in ./packs.object.hi.ts and ./packs.object.bn.ts (complete for every key: tests/object-page.unit.mjs
 * checks it). Registered additively through registerPack(); no existing pack is edited. Every key starts
 * with `obj_` (the `v3_` prefix belongs to packs.v3, which this phase may not edit).
 *
 * Copy rules (v2 §11 + V3 §7.6): sentence case, at most one " · " per string (a run-time join puts the
 * separators between facts), say what happens, what does not, and how sure. Numbers and times stay in
 * Latin digits in all three languages.
