/**
 * The Decide string pack (V3-SPEC §6.2, §7.8) — every string /decide prints that the v2 decision packs
 * (packs.decisions, packs.dss) and the V3 pack (packs.v3) do not already say. EN here; HI and BN in
 * ./packs.decide.hi.ts and ./packs.decide.bn.ts, complete for every key (tests/decide.unit.mjs checks it).
 * Registered additively through registerPack(); no existing pack is edited. Every key starts with `v3d_`.
 *
 * Copy rules (v2 §11 + V3 §7.6): sentence case, no ALL-CAPS word outside the acronym list, at most one
 * " · " per string, titles ≤ 32 characters. Say what happens, what does not, and how sure. The officer
 * helper is §9.1's sentence, word for word. Numbers and times stay in Latin digits in all three languages.
