/**
 * The V3 Assistant string pack (V3-SPEC §5.7, §7.6, §7.8) — every string /assistant prints that the assistant pack
 * (packs.assistant: the grounding note, the interrupted turn) and the V3 pack (packs.v3) do not already say. EN
 * here; HI and BN in ./packs.asst3.hi.ts and ./packs.asst3.bn.ts, complete for every key (tests/v3-assistant.unit.mjs
 * checks it). Registered additively; loaded only by /assistant. Every key starts with `v3a_`.
 *
 * Copy rules (§7.6): say what happens, what does not, and how sure. Model diagnostics become ONE human sentence
 * (the caution keys); raw codes, tool names and model ids stay in Analyst → AI trace and never reach this page.
 * The assistant reads and proposes; it never approves, dispatches or unmasks — the copy says so where it matters.
