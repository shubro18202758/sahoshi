/**
 * The field AI string pack — the voice report sheet, the object page's road-state, forecast and waterlogging panels,
 * and the public pages' waterlogging card and Listen button. EN here; HI and BN in ./packs.field.hi.ts and
 * ./packs.field.bn.ts (complete for every key: tests/field.unit.mjs and tests/bn-script.unit.mjs check it). Registered
 * additively through registerPack(); no existing pack is edited. Every key starts with `fld_`. The five strings the
 * first paint needs (the top bar entry, the two honest tags) are ./packs.field.core.ts.
 *
 * Copy rules (as the object pack): sentence case, at most one " · " per string, say what happens, what does not and how
 * sure. Honest labels are words in a tag ("Unverified field report", "Simulated", "Modelled"), the code on a data
 * attribute. Numbers arrive already formatted (public pages pass the reader's digits; the console Latin digits).
 * Public copy addresses the reader politely ("Please …"; আপনি in Bengali, आप in Hindi).
