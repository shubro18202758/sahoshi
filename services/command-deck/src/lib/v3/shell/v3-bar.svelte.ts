/**
 * The V3 top bar's page-owned fields (V3-SPEC §3.1): the screen title and its one-line status. Everything
 * else the V3 shell shows comes through the v2 shell↔page contract it reuses unchanged
 * ($lib/shell/command-bar.svelte: lang, onLangChange, onSearch, officer, exercise, inboxCount, live), so a
 * page talks to the V3 shell exactly the way it talked to the v2 CommandShell (retired in P6B). The shell never imports a store.
 *
 * V3Shell clears these on every route change, before the next page mounts (as the v2 shell cleared
 * commandBar).
