/**
 * The Plan string pack (V3-SPEC §6.6, §7.8; V3-P4B) — every string /plan prints. EN here; HI and BN in
 * ./packs.plan.hi.ts and ./packs.plan.bn.ts, complete for every key (tests/v3-plan.unit.mjs checks it).
 * Registered additively through registerPack(); no existing pack is edited. Every key starts with `v3p_`.
 *
 * Copy rules (v2 §11 + V3 §7.6): sentence case, no ALL-CAPS word outside the acronym list, at most one " · " per
 * string, titles (keys ending `heading`) ≤ 32 characters. Say what happens, what does not, and how sure. The
 * officer helper is §9.1's sentence, word for word. Numbers and times stay in Latin digits in all three languages.
