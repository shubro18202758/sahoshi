	/**
	 * GodsEyeCanvas — the Cesium God's-eye canvas.
	 *
	 * Keyless by default (re-graded dark OSM raster + ellipsoid terrain + our
	 * own entities — zero calls to cesium.com/ion); env-keyed ion upgrade via
	 * the server-side mode endpoint, built from the async ion factories and
	 * falling back to keyless when the token or ion fails. Sensor modes:
	 * COMMAND (the raw render — the default, because a luminance-mapped scene
	 * erases every colour the layers carry) and the opt-in FLIR looks
	 * (White-Hot / Black-Hot / Ironbow). A share-link camera URL, and the
	 * layer registry (gods-eye-view MIT pattern — see registry.ts).
	 *
	 * HUD modes: 'full' (SAHOSHI CITY COMMAND /gods-eye — EXIT chip + Esc back to
	 * the wall; the page hosts the entity dossier, the vitals and the fusion
	 * rail around this canvas) · 'mini' (compact chip row) · 'wall' (the
	 * cockpit '/' and the /ops situation wall):
	 *   - AUTO-ORBIT (wall only): 30 s after the last interaction the camera
	 *     orbits a ground pivot — the locked subject, else the screen-centre
	 *     ground point inside the city, else the city centre — inside an
	 *     east-north-up frame at that pivot (rotateRight about the LOCAL up
	 *     axis). Any interaction, flight, tour or follow hands the camera back
	 *     to the world frame, and an idle camera that leaves the city bbox
	 *     flies home. (The first orbit rotated about Earth's polar axis and
	 *     carried the city off-screen in ~40 s.)
	 *   - SUBJECT FOLLOW (/ops): selecting a live event flies to its spine
	 *     once and locks; the follow tracks the selection id only, so board
	 *     polls never re-fly, and RELEASE sticks (across views too — a
	 *     released subject is not re-locked until the selection moves).
	 *   - FOCUS BUS (focus.svelte.ts): board surfaces request a fly + lock;
	 *     LOCKED is shown only when the flight lands (a drag or wheel during
	 *     the flight cancels it), and a canvas serves only requests made
	 *     after it mounted — the next view never replays the last request.
	 *   - SELECTION (entities/selection.svelte.ts): every pick maps through its
	 *     layer to a C-C URN and selects that entity (event URNs also select
	 *     the event on the board); the selected entity wears a halo and its
	 *     primitives stay highlighted. A fly request (fusion-rail row, dossier
	 *     chip, tour) flies to the entity's fused position — the registry's,
	 *     else its dossier's — and reports landed / no-position.
	 *   - PICKING: on the wall views the layer's description opens a pick
	 *     card; on City Command the dossier replaces it (the pick text rides
	 *     into the dossier's MAP line). Hover highlights the entity.
	 *   - PURSUIT OVERLAY (head-first trace + comet + choke cascade + marching
	 *     future arc — pursuit.ts), redrawn only when the plan changes, with
	 *     the plan's stale / likely-passed / direction-of-travel facts.
	 *   - GUIDED TOUR: camera choreography over targets computed from the
	 *     LIVE city picture (posture, the pursuit, the busiest camera, the
	 *     units, the planned convoy, the signal network, the e-challan pins),
	 *     skipping what is empty; on City Command each stop opens its dossier.
	 *   - REPLAY (hud/replay.svelte.ts + replay.ts): an emulator tape on the
	 *     viewer clock — EVERY live layer stands down while it plays (a 'LIVE
	 *     paused' chip says so), so the replayed frames are what is on screen;
	 *     every replayed primitive is badged EMULATED.
	 *   - AGENTIC GOD'S-EYE (canvas-bus.svelte.ts, contract C-D2): the agent's
	 *     canvas directives queue as 'AI suggests: <verb> <label> [Apply]
	 *     [Dismiss]' chips. Apply runs the move LOCALLY (fly / select / halo /
	 *     a TTL note / sensor / layer) and acknowledges it to the brain once;
	 *     nothing is ever auto-applied. ⌘K / Ctrl+K opens the command palette
	 *     (hud full + wall). An 'Open on map' from the agent console is
	 *     served when City Command mounts.
	 *   - PICKING PRIORITY: a click drill-picks up to 8 primitives and takes
	 *     the operator's likely target by layer (unit > camera > vehicle mark
	 *     > signal > pursuit > event > segment); the halo and non-entity
	 *     picks (3D tile features of the photoreal layer, C-L) never win.
	 *     Draped lines share the road's pixels, so a pursuit LINE lying on
	 *     an event's spine ranks just after the event (its markers keep
	 *     their rank).
	 *   - 3D CITY (layers/draping.ts): on the ion key the overlays stand ON
	 *     Google's photoreal mesh — the selection halo is a draped ring, an
	 *     agent note a clamped label; City Command's home is a presentation-grade
	 *     oblique from the city pack (HOME_VIEW_3D: for Kolkata, over Esplanade
	 *     and BBD Bag toward Howrah Bridge and the Hooghly; the
	 *     live action framed at ACTION_VIEW_3D); the chip names what is on
	 *     screen (basemap.ts imageryChip — 'Photoreal 3D · Google') and the
	 *     data credits ride a glass plate in the region the host's panels
	 *     leave clear (City Command's fusion rail would cover them).
	 *
	 * Ethics rail (C6): every plate this canvas prints is masked unless a
	 * named duty officer is on console (plates.ts) — at the source (layer
	 * descriptions, tour labels, focus notes) AND again at every text sink
	 * (pick card, LOCKED chip, flash line, tour label, test snapshot), so a
	 * layer that forgets to mask a free-text prop still never shows a plate.
	 *
	 * Degradation contract: if WebGL or the prebuilt bundle is unavailable
	 * this panel degrades ALONE. If OSM tiles cannot load, the canvas switches
	 * to 'Offline schematic mode' (entities over a dark globe, labelled).
	 *
	 * CHROME (SPEC §5.3, plan X11): `chrome="legacy"` (the default) is the
	 * chip row above, unchanged — every page keeps it until its owner opts
	 * in. `chrome="v2"` is the redesign's map chrome: the toolbar (Select,
	 * Select within shape, Search around, Measure · Layers, Legend · Follow,
	 * Live/Replay, Guided tour, Thermal-style view, Exit map mode), zoom and
	 * north at the bottom right above Cesium's credits, the readout at the
	 * bottom left, the LayerTree, the legend, MapProposals and the replay
	 * banner (hud/map/*); and the symbology in which colour means only state
	 * (hud/map/symbols.ts): neutral glyph discs, clusters under 22 px with a
	 * count chip (a click spiderfies them), the offset vehicle pin, one
	 * decision dot per object, greedy labels (hud/map/labels.ts), the
	 * selection's hierarchy and the time window's fading with protected
	 * objects (hud/map/view.ts). The v2 pass (decorate) restyles markers in
	 * place on camera-move end and on data change, never per frame. The
	 * omnibar mount (CommandPalette, hud 'full' | 'wall') is the same under
	 * both chromes, and the __GODS_EYE__ contract is unchanged.
