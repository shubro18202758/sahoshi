/**
 * Plate display rail (C6) — vehicles are identified by ANPR plate only,
 * and a plate is shown MASKED (WB06EM•••1) on every canvas, dossier and
 * feed surface unless a named duty officer is on console (SPEC §9.3: no
 * raw mark in DOM text without a named officer).
 *
 * The mark rule is the workspace's (src/lib/workspace/mask.ts, imported,
 * never copied: one rule for the whole deck). The oracle (city/common.py)
 * masks every label and feed text it sends, but only a mark as the server
 * writes it — upper case, a space or a dash between the parts. Text that
 * reaches these sinks is often not the server's: an officer's typed note,
 * a pursuit's title, an emulator tape, a brain answer, an evidence payload.
 * So a mark is masked here in any case and spelling:
 *
 *   WB06EM9001 · wb06em9001 · Wb 06 Em 9001 · WB.06.EM.9001 · WB/06/EM/9001 · WB_06_EM_9001
 *
 * all keep their state code, RTO number and series and hide the 4-digit
 * number but its last digit (…•••1). The rule, from mask.ts:
 *   - a mark starts with one of the 39 Indian state / union-territory
 *     codes (STATE_CODES), in any case — never any two letters;
 *   - up to three of space, `.`, `-`, `/`, `_` between the parts;
 *   - a UUID (a URN's id) is held out, so a hex group is never a mark;
 *   - a spaced candidate whose series spells a month is a date and is left
 *     alone ("24 Oct 2026", "on 12 oct 2026") unless the state code and the
 *     series are both upper case ("WB 01 MAY 1234" is a mark);
 *   - text that holds no mark comes back as it was, byte for byte.
 * An upper-case mark masks exactly as it did before (and as the oracle's
 * mask does): WB06EM9001 → WB06EM•••1, WB 02 AB 1234 → WB 02 AB •••4. The
 * one narrowing is mask.ts's (review r3): two letters that are no state
 * code ("AB12CD3456") no longer read as a mark.
 * A named duty officer sees every text raw.
