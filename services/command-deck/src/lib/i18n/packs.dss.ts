/**
 * The decision-support string pack (EN / HI / BN) — the `dss` decision unit,
 * its ProposalCard body (COA review), the inspector section, the promote
 * action and the client refusals (OS-DECK-B; plan X22, contracts C-U/C-T).
 * Registered additively through registerPack(); the core packs stay
 * untouched. Every key starts with `dss_`.
 *
 * The rule note is pinned VERBATIM by tests/dss.unit.mjs (plan X22):
 * "The engine proposes; a named officer decides. Approving creates dispatch
 * requests (each decided on its own) and, when the response needs a corridor
 * event, promotes this report to one."
 *
 * `dec_done_reject_pursuit` / `dec_done_defer_pursuit` live here (additively;
 * the decisions pack does not define them): the ProposalCard's outcome verb
 * for every non-escort, non-corridor, non-e-challan kind reads the
 * `…_pursuit` suffix, and a rejected or deferred proposal must not render a
 * raw key.
 *
 * EN is sentence case, at most one " · " per string, no ALL-CAPS word
 * outside the acronym allowlist (DSS, COA, ICCC, AHP pass; tests/copy-lint.mjs
 * over tests/style-lint.targets/dss.json). HI and BN are complete for every
 * key. Copy describes only what the system does: approving creates dispatch
 * requests (each decided on its own) and, when the response needs a corridor
 * event, promotes the report to one; nothing applies itself.
