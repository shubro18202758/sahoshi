/**
 * Citizen-screens string pack (EN / HI / BN) — the public copy for the
 * rebuilt /citizen advisory, the /driver green-corridor flow, the (deck)
 * /comms advisory desk and the /chat console.
 *
 * The i18n CORE (strings.ts) is frozen per contract; this module registers
 * its keys additively via the design-shell `registerPack()` extension
 * point (idempotent, never overrides). `citizenT()` additionally resolves
 * against this pack FIRST and falls back to the core `t()` — the same
 * pattern as the ops stream's `tOps()` — so components have one resolver
 * and the frozen packs stay intact even if registration has not run.
 *
 * Copy rules (per the language spec): plain-language consequences, never
 * internal codes — citizens never see GREEN/AMBER/RED/BLACK; road names stay
 * transliterated as on city signage; every mutable number is localized by the
 * caller through localizeNumber().
