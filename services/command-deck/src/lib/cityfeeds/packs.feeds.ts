/**
 * The city-feeds string pack — the City chip row (Air · Heat · Cyclone · River · Quake), its sheet, the air and
 * cyclone map layers and the citizen page's "Air today". EN here; HI and BN in ./packs.feeds.hi.ts and
 * ./packs.feeds.bn.ts, complete for every key (tests/cityfeeds.unit.mjs checks it). Every key starts with `cf_`.
 *
 * Copy rules (as packs.ai): sentence case, no ALL-CAPS word outside the acronym list, at most one " · " per
 * string, titles ≤ 32 characters. Honest labels say what a number is: live, modelled, indicative, aggregate,
 * recorded. Numbers stay in Latin digits in the console; the public card renders them in the reader's digits.
 * A proposal is always a proposal; a named officer decides; if no one decides, the current plan holds.
