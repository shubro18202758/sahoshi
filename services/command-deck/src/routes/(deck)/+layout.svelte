	/**
	 * (deck) — the operator surfaces that are v2 pages (/analyst, /ops, /gods-eye, /chat, /comms and the /design
	 * galleries), drawn inside the V3 shell (V3-P6B): the same rail and top bar, in the same pixels, as every V3
	 * screen (V3-SPEC §3.1, the colleague review: uniform navigation). Command theme (command-graphite) and the V3
	 * tokens; the pages supply the command-bar state they own and keep their own layouts, stores and test ids.
	 *
	 * What only these pages need — the Analyst views, the band tag, the Inbox, the Data button, Policies, More and
	 * the live strip — is the OpsBand under the top bar. The page then sits in the same flex column the v2 shell's
	 * `main` was, so no page's geometry changes (only the chrome above it).
	 *
	 * The operator gate's session is read HERE, once per mount of any operator route: with the gate on
	 * (SAHOSHI_OPERATOR_PIN) the officer the deck verified becomes the duty officer everywhere — the ops store (started
	 * by every one of those pages) follows the shell's session state and adopts it: plates unmask for them, writer
	 * controls unlock, and the manual officer fields lock to that name, which is the name the server audits
	 * (x-sahoshi-officer). Signing out releases it. This layout itself stays on the design-shell side of the R4
	 * boundary (it never imports the ops store).
