/**
 * Where tests/screens-verify.mjs writes when it is given no output directory.
 *
 * `tests/artifacts/screens/` holds TRACKED evidence of record (the PNGs and
 * screens_manifest.json that the repo's release-consistency script reads),
 * regenerated only on the live deck (live gate LG 21). Only the live deck's
 * origin — port 5273 — may default there. Every other origin (a vite dev deck
 * such as :5401, a sandbox deck such as int3cl's :5262, a :5199 preview, an
 * unparseable origin) defaults to the untracked, gitignored
 * `tests/artifacts/screens-dev/`, and screens-verify says so. A WP always
 * passes its own evidence directory as the second argument anyway.
 *
 *   defaultScreensDir('http://127.0.0.1:5273')  → 'tests/artifacts/screens'
 *   defaultScreensDir('http://127.0.0.1:5401')  → 'tests/artifacts/screens-dev'
 *
 * The path is relative to services/command-deck.
