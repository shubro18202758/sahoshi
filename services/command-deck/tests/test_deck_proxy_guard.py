"""Deck edge regression (gate-venv python): proxy guard, hardening, operator gate.

The edge itself is TypeScript (src/hooks.server.ts + the operator-session
and public-projection modules), so this module has two rungs:

* SOURCE CONTRACT (pure python, no node): the authority-pinning refusal
  exists and runs BEFORE the upstream fetch (the live-confirmed open proxy:
  /api/convoy//127.0.0.1:8091/health once fetched the traffic-oracle through
  the brain rule), the upstream targets stay pinned loopback literals, the
  WebSocket 501 answer precedes any proxying, and the R26 machine-ingest
  refusal (POST /api/v1/osint/signals, 403) precedes both the gate and the
  upstream fetch.
* BEHAVIOUR (node): bundles tests/ops-guard.entry.ts with the vendored
  esbuild and runs it — authority pinning, 501-on-upgrade, header hygiene,
  the nonce CSP, the opt-in SAHOSHI_OPERATOR_PIN gate (default-deny on the
  canonical, once-decoded path: %-encoded operator feeds, the interception
  plan, the raw events feed and one event row by id refused; the anonymous
  ambulance request capped per client) and its /api/session sign-in, the
  public projection's allowlist and hold provenance, the driver status
  OSINT firewall failing CLOSED (an unreadable event row 503, an absent or
  OSINT-sourced one not-found, never the dispatch body; a failed read
  cached for the poll window), the doctrine window timing, and the C-D chat
  parser. The suite stubs fetch, so nothing leaves the process.
  Equivalent manual run from services/command-deck:

      node_modules/.bin/esbuild tests/ops-guard.entry.ts --bundle \\
          --platform=node --format=esm --alias:$lib=./src/lib \\
          --outfile=tests/artifacts/ops-guard-bundle.mjs \\
          && node tests/artifacts/ops-guard-bundle.mjs

The behaviour rung skips (with the reason) only when node or the vendored
esbuild is absent; it never passes vacuously.
