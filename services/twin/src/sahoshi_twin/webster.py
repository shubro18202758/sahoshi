"""Webster's optimal fixed-time cycle and green split (Webster 1958).

For a junction with phases p, each with a critical flow ratio
``y_p = max(q/s)`` over the approaches the phase serves, and total lost
time ``L`` per cycle:

    C0 = (1.5 L + 5) / (1 - Y),   Y = sum_p y_p
    g_p = (C0 - L) * y_p / Y      (effective green)

C0 is clamped to [MIN_CYCLE_S, MAX_CYCLE_S]; at Y >= 0.95 the junction is
oversaturated, the formula breaks down, and the maximum cycle is used with
greens in proportion to y (flagged ``oversaturated``).

``webster_delay`` is Webster's average delay per vehicle on one approach,
used by the tests to show that C0 sits at (or very near) the delay minimum.
