"""Independence-aware credibility and an honest verification state (OSINT SPEC §1.5, §4 "credibility").

Credibility rises ONLY on independent corroboration:

* the base is the strongest member prior (``credibility_prior``: official 0.95, news 0.60, social 0.25);
* **cross-type** corroboration — members of more than one trust type (official, news, social; every news tier,
  wire, regional, aggregator or archive, is one type) — adds :data:`CROSS_TYPE_BUMP` per extra type;
* **cross-publisher within a type** adds :data:`PUBLISHER_BUMP` per extra independent publisher of the same type,
  capped at :data:`PUBLISHER_BUMP_CAP` in all;
* independence is judged by the RESOLVED publisher domain (:func:`resolve_publisher`: the registrable domain, so
  ``m.``/``www.`` and sub-sites of one outlet are one publisher; a community stays ``host/r/<name>``) and the trust
  type, NEVER by a URL or a URL prefix: an aggregator's links all share its host, and one outlet's links differ
  by path, so a URL proves nothing. A member without a resolved publisher adds no publisher independence;
* a single social source is capped at :data:`SINGLE_SOCIAL_CAP` (0.30), and so is a social-only situation from
  one community, however many posts it has;
* **cross-posts are one source** (orchestrator decision, OS-4 round 4): the posts of one community are one source,
  and two communities are one source when a post of one is a near-duplicate of a post of the other
  (:func:`near_duplicate`: the same text posted twice may be one poster). Independence between social sources
  is therefore only ever shown by posts whose texts are NOT near-duplicates (:func:`social_sources`);
* **syndicated copies are one source** (F-HONEST OSINT-4): the same rule across every news tier. One wire story
  carried by N outlets (a PTI text, an aggregator's copy) is one source, so it neither raises credibility nor
  shows as "N independent publishers" (:func:`news_sources`);
* the result never exceeds :data:`CREDIBILITY_CEILING` (0.99): certainty is an officer's call (``CONFIRMED``).

The verification state is ``OFFICIAL-VERIFIED`` when an official member exists, else ``NEWS-REPORTED`` with a
news member, else ``UNVERIFIED-OSINT``; a member counts at the LOWER of what its tier and its provenance label
say. ``SIMULATED`` and ``EMULATED`` inputs pass through unchanged and are never upgraded: their state stays, their
credibility is the base prior with no corroboration bump, and they never claim cross-type corroboration (fusion
keeps them in their own partitions, so they never mix with real reports).

The EM Bypass case (two aggregator publishers) scores 0.60 → 0.65, ``NEWS-REPORTED``.
