"""``run_pipeline(...)``: geocoded signals → honest situations (the OS-4 contract; X18).

    run_pipeline(signals, *, resolver: GeoResolver, live: LiveStateSnapshot | None = None,
                 embedder: Embedder | None = None, now: datetime | None = None) -> PipelineResult

Classify every signal, resolve it through the injected resolver, fuse within a class (Stage 1), correlate related
classes (Stage 2), score credibility, attach each situation read-only to the live state, flag second-order effects,
count. Pure and deterministic: no database, no network except the optional embedder; the same input (in any
order) gives the same output. ``now`` only bounds report times (a report dated after ``now`` counts as ``now``);
the identity of a situation never depends on it.

**Surfacing.** A situation is an event (``is_event``) only for an incident or operational class, never when its
only source is one social post, never when its social-only posts are ONE social source (the posts of one
community, or near-duplicate cross-posts in several: :func:`osint_analysis.credibility.social_sources`; they may
be one poster), and never when all its geocodes are state-level. Otherwise it is held, with the first matching
``held_reason``: :data:`HELD_STATE_LEVEL`; :data:`HELD_SINGLE_SOCIAL` for one social post; :data:`HELD_NOT_EVENT`;
:data:`HELD_SINGLE_SOCIAL` for one social source. Both single-social rules read the situation's point-level
members only (:func:`identity_members`; see "Area context"), so an area-level member never counts as
corroboration of a point-level social report: a district alert cannot lift one person's post into an event
(fusion never attaches an area to a social-only point cluster in the first place; this is the second guard).
Held situations are returned for the counts and are never presented as events: no second-order flags, and no
live attach (a held situation is never checked against the live state, so one person's post is never linked to a
live event; ``attached_to_live`` counts surfaced situations only).

**Area context** (orchestrator decision, OS-4 round 4). A district-level member (an area alert or a district-level
report) attached to a point situation is CONTEXT, never verification: ``credibility``, ``verification_state``,
``cross_type_corroborated``, ``independent_publishers``, ``source_tiers``, ``labels``, the held rules and the time
window (``window_start``/``window_end``, which the live attach and the second-order checks read) all come from
the point-level members (:func:`identity_members`). ``OFFICIAL-VERIFIED`` therefore needs an official source
reporting the point-level situation itself: a Park Circus news report with a district SACHET alert attached stays
``NEWS-REPORTED`` at the news credibility. The area member stays attached and visible: it is a member
(``member_signal_ids``, ``source_count``) and a source, listed after every point-level member with the role
:data:`CONTEXT_ROLE`, so the operator sees that a district warning is in effect. An area-only situation (a
district alert alone) is scored on its own members, as before.

**Precision** (F-HONEST OSINT-3). A situation carries only the precision its report gave: a neighbourhood geocode
is an area (``area_level`` true, no segment, no junction: "Beleghata" is not the EM Bypass 1.3 km away), and a point
carries its snapped segment only when it lies on it (``fusion.Member.on_segment``: within
``fusion.SEGMENT_RESIDUAL_MAX_M``, 900 m). Decision support reads ``area_level`` and the segment from here, so an
area report never becomes a closure on a guessed road.

**Identity.** ``fused_event_id = sha1("anchor:" + earliest member signal_id by (published_at, signal_id))``
(``fetched_at`` stands in for a missing ``published_at``), over the situation's POINT-level members when it has
any (:func:`identity_members`). Adding a later report keeps the id. An area alert never anchors a point
situation: a district alert joins the one point cluster it fits best (:mod:`osint_analysis.fusion`), it may
re-attach to another cluster when later reports arrive, and the id must stay with the place (one Shyambazar report
must not leave its id at Garia, 15 km away, because the alert moved). A district or state situation is anchored
on its earliest member; when its first point report joins it, it becomes a situation at that place, under that
report's id (the district situation is absorbed by it: in OS-5's contract, ``superseded_by``).

**Text.** ``label = "<class label> · <toponym | Kolkata district>"``; ``summary`` = the primary member's
redacted title, at most 200 characters; each source's ``title`` at most 1 000 (``SourceRef``). Every one is fitted
by :func:`fit_text` before it leaves: a poster handle that slipped through parse is stripped by the same helper
the analysis reads through (:func:`osint_analysis.classify.strip_handles`: the ``submitted by …`` trailer goes,
any other ``/u/<name>`` or ``u/<name>`` becomes ``[PERSON]``), a surviving PII span is redacted, the text is
clipped to its limit, and the clipped text is checked with ``ethics.find_pii`` AGAIN (a cut can leave a fragment
that reads as a name: the "Dr. <name>" of a protected gazetteer place "Dr. <name> Road"). A text that a redaction
lengthens past its limit, or a clip that exposes a fragment, can therefore never fail the output model and sink
the batch.

**Source links.** ``SourceRef.url`` is kept for the official tier only (SACHET/NDMA, IMD, SDMA: identifier-only
paths) and is ``None`` for every news and social tier (the orchestrator decision carried by OS-5: their URL slugs
can name a person and are never PII-scanned). A source stays verifiable by its ``signal_id`` (a hash of its source
and source id) and its publisher domain.

**Counts** (``PipelineCounts``, the PoC's ``MACHINE_RESULT`` semantics): ``signals``; ``geotagged`` (any class);
``incident_geotagged``; ``fused`` (every situation); ``surfaced``; ``correlated`` (surfaced with more than one
class); ``cross_type_corroborated``; ``social_held`` (held, tiers only ``social_unverified``); ``outside_city_held``
(held, every geocode state-level); ``pii_redactions`` (sum over signals); ``attached_to_live``.
