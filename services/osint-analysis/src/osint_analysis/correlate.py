"""Stage 2 of the two-stage fusion: correlate co-located, time-overlapping base clusters of RELATED classes into
one situation (OSINT SPEC §1.5). This is the composite a single-class deduper misses: the EM Bypass
``road_accident`` reports near Kasba and the co-located "beaten by mob" ``public_conflict`` report become one
``affray+collision`` situation.

Two base clusters join when (all of):

* their classes form a :data:`osint_common.kinds.RELATED_CLASSES` pair, and their realms match;
* they are **co-located at the same level**: two point clusters whose representatives (the highest-confidence
  point members) are within :data:`CORRELATE_RADIUS_M` (the PoC's 1 200 m) or on one segment with a line geocode;
  two district clusters of the same district; two state clusters of the same state. A state-level cluster never
  joins a district or point situation (plan R28), and an area-wide alert does not locate a point situation by
  containment alone: a district alert and a point report join only through Stage 1's text evidence. Otherwise
  a district-wide warning would label a street report "Official, verified" and absorb unrelated points;
* they **overlap in time**: the gap between their windows is at most the wider of the two class windows (state
  aggregates have no window).

**One cluster per class.** A situation never holds two base clusters of the same class: Stage 1 kept them apart
because they are two incidents, and a report between them must not chain them back together (a clash report
1.1 km from two accidents 2.2 km apart joins ONE of them). The candidate joins are taken nearest first (the
distance between the representatives to the metre, 0 for two areas; ties by the earlier clusters), and a join is
refused when the two groups already share a class. So each situation has at most one base cluster of each class,
and the outcome does not depend on the input order.

The situation's primary class follows :data:`osint_common.kinds.RESPONSE_PRIORITY`, ties broken deterministically:
more member reports first, then the earliest report, then the class order of
:data:`osint_common.kinds.EVENT_CLASS_NAMES` (so a ``road_accident`` cluster of three reports leads a one-report
``public_conflict``, both priority 8).
