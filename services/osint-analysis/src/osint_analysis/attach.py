"""Attach, don't duplicate (OSINT SPEC §1.5): check each situation, READ-ONLY, against the live corridor state.

A situation **corroborates** a live event when it reports the SAME situation, that is when (all of):

* the live ref is a corridor event: an ``event:`` URN (C-T's dossier relation ``corroborates`` points at an
  event). A convoy in motion (``convoy:`` / ``movement:``), a dispatch or any other ref is never corroborated;
* the event is ``active``. An event in planning or approved has not started, and a live ref carries no time
  window that could show an overlap;
* the event's kind is one the situation's classes can be (:data:`CORROBORATING_KINDS`): an accident report
  corroborates a ``road_accident`` event, a crowd report a ``mass_gathering``. Nothing corroborates a
  ``protected_movement`` (an accident on a VVIP route is a second-order effect, flagged by
  :mod:`osint_analysis.second_order`, not the movement itself), a ``vehicle_pursuit`` (human-initiated) or a
  ``crime_incident`` (ANPR/watchlist origin): OSINT never links a report to either;
* they are co-located: the event's point is within :data:`ATTACH_RADIUS_M` (900 m) of the situation's point, or
  the situation lies on a segment of the event's route (``segment_ids``);
* they overlap in time: the situation is still current at the snapshot (``window_end`` + its class window ≥
  ``as_of``). A stale report never corroborates today's event.

Otherwise it is ``novel``. The nearest corroborated event wins (an in-radius event before a route-only match, then
the distance, then the URN). Three kinds of situation are always novel, because they cannot honestly corroborate a
specific live event: an area-level situation (a district or state alert has no precise location), a non-event
class (chatter), and any situation when no live state is given. The pipeline checks SURFACED situations only: a
held one (a single social post, one community's posts, chatter, a state-wide alert) is reported novel unchecked,
so one person's post is never linked to a live event.

Nothing here writes: the snapshot is only read, and the result is a new :class:`AttachResult`.
