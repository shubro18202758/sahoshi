"""Poster handles are never a cue (ethics rule 2: a handle is never stored, shown, tracked or scored).

A handle that survives parse (most Reddit RSS texts end in "submitted by /u/<name> [link] [comments]") must never
classify a post, never add a similarity token, never reach an embedder, and never leave the pipeline; so two posts
by ONE poster are never more alike than the same two posts by two posters. The texts here are synthetic Kolkata
posts, in English and in Bengali (a Bengali post carries the same English trailer)."""
