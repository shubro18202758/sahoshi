"""Ethics rails enforced in code (OSINT SPEC §0 and §4): events are about PLACES and SITUATIONS, never persons.

Two checks every OSINT record passes before it is stored or displayed:

* :func:`assert_no_person_keys` — no key at any depth names a person: author, handle, username, byline,
  reporter, poster, uploader, suspect, accused, victim, owner, driver_name, face, biometric or individual_*
  (:data:`FORBIDDEN_KEY_RE`, the spec §4 denylist, frozen). It raises ``ValueError("forbidden_key:<key>")``.
* :func:`find_pii` — no person name or age survived redaction: the age expressions and the cue- or
  honorific-introduced names of the PoC's parse-time redactor (``_AGE_RES`` and ``_NAME_CUE_RE``), also when the
  name is written with initials ("Mr R. K. <surname>"), an age right after a redacted name ("[PERSON], 45,") and a
  parenthesised age ("<Name> (45)"). It returns ``[]`` when the text is clean, otherwise one short descriptor per
  hit (``"age:years_old"``, ``"age:paren"``, ``"name:Mr"``). A descriptor never repeats the name or the age, so it
  is safe in an error message or a log line. The cues are case-sensitive, as in the PoC, so a Title Case headline
  ("Accused Held For Robbery") is not mangled. A text that is not plain ASCII is also read through its detection
  view (NFKC, Unicode format characters removed), so a zero-width space, a soft hyphen or fullwidth letters
  cannot hide a name; the stored text is never changed.

Key matching fails closed. A key (as given, and NFKC-normalised) is a person key when the frozen denylist matches
it ANYWHERE, case-insensitively (``authorname``, ``userName``, ``faceprint``, ``victimname``, and also
``interface``, ``authority``, ``handler`` or ``ownership``: a lookalike is refused, never guessed harmless), OR
when one of its tokens does after splitting on ``_``, non-alphanumerics and camelCase (``driverName`` →
``driver_name``, ``individualId`` → ``individual_id``). Two things escape. One is a whole opaque id
(:data:`OPAQUE_ID_RE`: a 40-hex sha1 signal id or a canonical uuid, whose hex digits can spell ``face`` by chance).
The other is :data:`EXEMPT_KEYS`, exactly the contract keys that collide with the denylist and name no person:
``touches_persons`` (the C-U COA ethics assertion that a course of action touches NO person), ``surfaced``
(``PipelineCounts.surfaced``) and ``surface_forms`` (the X19 gazetteer's spellings of a place).
:func:`assert_no_person_keys` allows each exempt key only with its contract value type (a bool, an int, a list of
strings), so an exempt key cannot carry a name either.

Place protection (so toponyms are never flagged): a cue-introduced capitalised name is not PII when it is a
gazetteer place, e.g. "resident of Park Street" or "Dr. Suresh Sarkar Road". The captured words must be covered
by gazetteer phrases (multi-word phrases always; single-word aliases only after a residence cue, so "Mr Hazra" is
still flagged although "hazra" names the crossing) and generic place or newsroom words; after an honorific
(:data:`HONORIFIC_CUES`) generic words alone are not enough, so "Mr Ghosh" or "Dr Ward" is a name. A phrase is
matched against the source text, so it may run past the 1-3 captured words: "resident of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee
Road" and "resident of Biswa Bangla Sarani" are places. The gazetteer is read
once, lazily, from ``OSINT_GAZETTEER_PATH``, else the repo's ``scripts/data/osint_gazetteer.json`` (walking up from
this file), else ``/repo/VVIP/scripts/data/...`` (the images). Without it, protection falls back to the generic
words only, which can only flag MORE, never less.

Redaction that always passes :func:`find_pii`: replace every :func:`pii_spans` span with ``[PERSON]`` (kind
``"name"``) or ``[AGE]`` (kind ``"age"``). The spans are offsets into the text as given, also for a hit found
through the detection view. ``[PERSON]`` and ``[AGE]`` are never flagged.

This module depends on the standard library only.
