"""Canonical SYNTHETIC fixtures for every OSINT WP (X18; plan R13).

Synthetic replicas of the PoC's cases, never real captures:

* the publishers are fictional (``news-a.example``, ``news-b.example``, and ``social-a.example`` for the Reddit
  replica, whose community ``example_city`` is fictional too): no fabricated text is attributed to a real outlet
  or community. Only the official alerts name a real publisher, ``sachet.ndma.gov.in`` (public-domain NDMA CAP),
  and their text is written here;
* no real person's name appears anywhere: the person names and ages the replicas "had" are already redacted to
  ``[PERSON]`` / ``[AGE]``, exactly as a connector emits them (``pii_redactions`` counts them);
* the toponyms are Kolkata's and the class cues the PoC's: a crash on EM Bypass near Kasba (segment 1035, Ruby
  crossing to Science City), a robbery at Gariahat crossing (junction 23), a Kolkata-district SACHET alert and a
  West Bengal state-wide SACHET nowcast naming other districts.

Every function returns fresh objects (mutating one never leaks into another test) and is deterministic: fixed
timestamps, ids derived with :func:`osint_common.types.signal_id_for` and ``uuid5``.
