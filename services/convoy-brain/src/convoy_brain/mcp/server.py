"""MCP Server — exposes traffic-oracle capabilities as standard MCP primitives.

Implements a lightweight Model Context Protocol server with:
- Resources: read-only data access (live traffic, anomalies, corridor summaries)
- Tools: executable functions (route optimizer, flow forecaster, ETA predictor,
  diversion planner, scenario evaluator, spatial queries), the READ-ONLY
  city tools over the fused picture (contract C-C: entities, dossiers, the
  city feed, signals, units, dispatches, the interception plan, the
  situation log, e-challan recommendations) and the CANVAS verbs
- Prompts: reusable system prompt templates for VVIP security protocols

Transport: STDIO (for same-host Docker deployment), or JSON-RPC 2.0 over
HTTP (POST /mcp on the brain, contract C-D2).

Read-only rail (R2): no tool approves, decides, dispatches, earmarks,
withdraws or transitions anything — every human decision stays a human
action on the ops wall. The executor's POSTs go to a fixed allow-list of
compute endpoints (predict / optimize / evaluate / traffic-live /
simulate); every city tool is a GET. Ids interpolated into a path are
validated against the oracle's own grammar first, and a 404 answers
``{ok: false, not_found | not_deployed}`` instead of failing the turn.

Canvas verbs (canvas_fly_to, canvas_track_entity, canvas_highlight,
canvas_annotate, canvas_set_sensor, canvas_toggle_layer) never call HTTP:
they validate their arguments and return a DIRECTIVE — a proposal the
orchestrator streams to the deck, where a human applies or dismisses it.
The AI never moves the operator's camera on its own.

Error typing (consumed by the orchestrator's retry policy): every dispatch
failure surfaces as :class:`ToolExecutionError`. Deterministic failures —
missing/malformed arguments (KeyError/TypeError/ValueError) and HTTP 4xx from
the oracle — carry ``retryable=False`` so the caller never repeats them;
transport errors, timeouts, 429 and 5xx stay retryable.
