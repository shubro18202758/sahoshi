"""Vehicles and places, never people: the operator-chat screen for person identification.

Sahoshi works with vehicles (number plates, masked until a named officer is on
duty) and places. It never identifies, recognises, tracks or describes a
person, and it holds no face data. The models are asked to respect that, but a
question like "identify the person standing at Esplanade in camera 3" used to
reach the tools: the strategic tier looked the "person" up, found nothing, and
the answer read "I cannot identify the person" — as if a match would have been
named. :func:`screen_person_question` refuses such a question in code, before
any tool runs, with the reason.

It is deliberately narrow. Crowd and aggregate questions are the product's job
and pass: "how many people are at Esplanade", "crowd at Eden Gardens", "is it
safe for pedestrians on Strand Road", "track the convoy", "identify the
vehicle". Questions about an owner, a driver's name or a phone number are
answered by the existing personal-details fact (Sahoshi holds none).
