Two-tier wiring: the decider (model-host :8083) is the strategic brain and
llama-server (:8084) serves Gemma 4 12B as the tactical tier; both come from
config.load_service_urls() (env > sahoshi_models.yaml > compile-time defaults)
and are validated as platform service URLs (http/https on loopback hosts).

The background health loop feeds both tiers' health to the oracle's
degradation ladder (POST /api/v1/adaptive/health) on every poll, so the
city picture's degradation tier reflects the brain's real state.

Escort authority ("officer approves every switch", 2026-10-23): the escort's
decider only PROPOSES a route switch, Plan B, a hold or new closures; each
needs a named officer's approval before it runs, and one nobody answers in
VVIP_ESCORT_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_SEC expires — the convoy holds its current
approved plan (workflows/live_escort.py).

Officer attribution: the deck forwards the verified session's officer as
``x-sahoshi-officer`` (percent-encoded) on every proxied call and strips any
client copy. The brain binds loopback, so on a loopback connection that
header is the actor of escort start / stop / clear / approval and of a
directive ack; a differing body ``officer`` is kept as ``claimed_officer``
in the audit row and the C-F note (mirror of traffic-oracle
units/router.py authenticated_officer).
