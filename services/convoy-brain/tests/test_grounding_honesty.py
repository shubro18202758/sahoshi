"""Honest by construction (FIX-G-BRAIN): grounding enforced in code.

Replays of the three invented answers the audit recorded on the sandbox brain
(impl/evidence/audit/F-HONEST/chat/t1, t2, t5) — offline: the decider, the
tactical model and the oracle are scripted with exactly what they did there —
plus the other honesty items of the work package:

    t1  HON-1/2  a road the network does not carry ("Kona Expressway") was
                 answered with three other roads' live data (example ids
                 1001-1003 copied) → resolved by name first: "no road segment
                 named …"; drafted ids no source reported are refused
    t2  HON-1    an unknown plate got an invented sighting place after empty /
                 failed lookups → deterministic "not in the city picture"; in a
                 grounded session the invented sentence is removed and said so
    t5  HON-3    an ETA for an ambulance while 0 units are fielded, from
                 invented predict_eta inputs → the call is refused, no unit ETA
    HON-3        an ETA on reported inputs keeps 'fallback' and ASSUMED INPUTS
    HON-5        a 'right now' answer from a days-old sighting carries its age
    HON-6/15     tool descriptions and prompt: no false model claims, no
                 example ids, no 'autonomous' / approving agent
    HON-12/F-CONN-10  AI-judgement endpoints retired (410, nothing written);
                 protocol writes need a named officer
    HON-13       citations name what the answer is about, not every lookup row
    HON-14       the session-grounding reads are streamed
    HON-16       the threat level is never a model's (not_assessed)
    HON-17       the forecast card says SIMULATED FEED and the rung
    COPY-10      the served model alias never reaches an operator
    F-CONN-06/09 ignored env reported; oracle URL from ORACLE_PORT; loopback bind
    F-CONN-13    events read by id (escort lifecycle)
    SUS-1        decision-support generation: its own bound, never re-sent
