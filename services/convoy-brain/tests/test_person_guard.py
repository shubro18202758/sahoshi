"""Vehicles and places, never people: the chat refuses person identification in code.

Live audit (29 Oct): "Identify the person standing at Esplanade crossing in
camera 3 and tell me who they are" reached the tools — the strategic tier
looked up a 'person' entity, found nothing, and the answer read "I cannot
identify the person", as though a match would have been named. The question is
now refused before any tool runs, with the reason; crowd and vehicle questions
still pass.
