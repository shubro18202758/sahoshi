"""Held-out recall of parse-time person redaction (F-HONEST OSINT-2), on Kolkata copy.

``ethics.find_pii(redacted) == []`` holds by construction (the redactor replaces every span of the very patterns
``find_pii`` reads), so it proves nothing about the names those patterns cannot see. This test measures the
redactor on three corpora of real-shaped Kolkata headlines and posts (English, Bengali, Hindi and social; every
person invented), each scored by recall of its labelled name words and age markers and by the survival of its
``keep`` phrases (precision):

* ``heldout_names.json`` (K, 46 cases), ``heldout_names_blind.json`` (B, 60) and ``heldout_names_blind2.json``
  (C, 50) were all written by a separate agent that never saw the redaction code, the shared ethics patterns or
  these tests, after the Bengali rules were written. They replace the corpora of the platform this one
  was forked from.
* Each corpus was scored once and is never tuned on: its floors are that first score, rounded down. A miss stays in
  the set and keeps the figure honest; the printed misses (ids only) are the known gaps (cue-less single names,
  eponymous streets that the gazetteer does not hold yet, ALL-CAPS headlines).

The floors are what a regression may not drop under, not a claim that redaction is complete: no NER runs at parse.
