"""Parse-time person redaction (OSINT SPEC §0.1(b), §4 "free text"): names → ``[PERSON]``, ages → ``[AGE]``.

Every connector runs its titles and texts through here BEFORE a :class:`~osint_common.types.RawOsintSignal` is
built, so nothing downstream (the oracle, the deck, a log) ever holds the name. The rules, in order:

1. **Ages and cue- or honorific-introduced names** (every tier): every span of
   :func:`osint_common.ethics.pii_spans` (the PoC's age patterns and ``_NAME_CUE_RE``, plus initials, "ASI",
   parenthesised ages, "[PERSON], 45,", zero-width or fullwidth disguises), place-aware through the gazetteer
   protect-set. Replacing every span is what makes ``ethics.find_pii(result) == []`` hold by construction. This
   module then redacts past where those spans stop:

   * a cue span runs on over up to two more name words: a fourth one ("Mr <A> <B> <C> <D>"), an initialled one
     ("Inspector <Given> D. <Surname>") or a hyphenated one ("<Surname>-<Surname>"). It stops at an ordinary,
     generic, headline (:data:`HEADLINE_WORDS`) or gazetteer word;
   * cue forms the shared pattern does not read: a comma after a role cue ("the victim, <Name>,"), "<role> as
     <Name>" ("identified the deceased as <Name>"), an honorific with no space ("Mr.<Name>", read exactly as
     "Mr. <Name>" is), and a Title-Case role cue before two or more name words ("Accused <Given> <Surname> Held");
   * the name right before an age ("<Given> <Surname>, [AGE]," / "<Given> <Surname> ([AGE])" / "..., aged 45"):
     the capitalised run up to the age, without its leading context words ("Behala Resident", "Elderly Woman";
     :data:`AGE_CONTEXT_WORDS`), so an occupational surname at its end stays inside the name;
   * two more age forms: "45 years of age" and "aged about 45", and Indic ones: Bengali ("৩৫ বছরের",
     "৪২ বছর বয়সী", "বয়স ৬০", "<name> (৬০)", "<name>, ৪৫,"; Bengali or Western digits) and Hindi ("28 वर्षीय",
     "45 साल के", "उम्र 60");
   * **cue-less names** (F-HONEST OSINT-2; :func:`_cueless_spans`): a role, kin or occupation noun before a name
     ("Biker <Given> <Surname> dies", "husband <Given> <Surname>", "Daughter of <Given> <Surname>"), a given name or
     initials before a common surname (:data:`SURNAMES`; a surname alone stays: "Ghosh family"), a name with an
     address suffix ("<Given>babu", "<Given>-da", "<Given>-di", "<Given>bhai"), both sides of "alias"/"urf"/"@",
     "<Given>, a <role>," and "<Name>'s body/family". No name word is a place, common, generic, headline or
     organisation word, so gazetteer phrases ("Netaji Subhas Road", "Santosh Mitra Square") and Title-Case
     headlines survive;
   * Bengali and Hindi cues in Indic script (:func:`_indic_cue_spans`): the words after an honorific (শ্রী,
     শ্রীমতী, ডাঃ, ডাক্তার; श्री, श्रीमती, डॉ.) are a name even when they are also ordinary words or places, and the
     unknown words after a role cue (অভিযুক্ত, ধৃত, মৃত, নিহত, আহত, বাসিন্দা, চালক; आरोपी, मृतक) are a name; a word
     before or ending in an address term (বাবু, দা, দি; "<name>বাবুর") is a name. These become ``[PERSON]``.
2. **Names learned in the same document** (every tier, :class:`DocumentRedactor`): a multi-word name that a cue
   introduced anywhere in one feed document ("content creator <Given> <Surname>") is also redacted where that
   document repeats it without the cue, and so is its surname written alone and capitalised ("<Surname> taught
   there"), unless that word is an ordinary, generic or gazetteer word. The names live in memory for one
   ``parse()`` and are never stored or logged. (This replaces the PoC's hard-coded ``_NAME_DENYLIST``, which named
   a real person and is not ported.)
3. **Reddit users** (every tier, ``official`` included): a Reddit user mention (``u/<name>``, ``/u/<name>``,
   ``/user/<name>``, ``r/u_<name>``) and a Reddit user page (``reddit.com/u/<name>``, ``/user/<name>``,
   ``/r/u_<name>``, any reddit.com host; the whole URL when one holds it) → ``[PERSON]``, wherever they appear: a
   news headline quoting "Reddit user u/<name>" names a poster as surely as a post does. These are exactly the
   forms :func:`has_poster_handle` reads in every tier, so no emitted title or text keeps one.
4. **URLs** (every tier but ``official``): a news or social URL can carry a person in its path (a slug made from
   an unredacted headline, a profile link) and is never stored (the orchestrator's URL decision), so every URL in
   a title or text is replaced. A Reddit user page becomes ``[PERSON]`` (rule 3); any other ``http(s)://…``,
   ``www.…`` or ``<host>.<tld>/<path>`` becomes ``[URL]`` (not "[LINK]": the analysis pipeline strips Reddit's
   "[link]" boilerplate case-blind). Official sources keep theirs (identifier-only paths), except a Reddit user
   page.
5. **Social tier only** (``social_unverified``, the most aggressively redacted tier):

   * a poster handle in the text beyond rule 3 (``@<name>``, and a handle named after a platform cue: "insta:
     <handle>", "IG id - <handle>") → ``[PERSON]``; an e-mail address or a mobile number → ``[CONTACT]``;
   * a poster's age and sex shorthand ("F(28)", "22M", "27/F", "(24F)") → ``[AGE]`` (F-HONEST OSINT-6), and a single
     given name after a social cue ("my neighbour <Given>", "contact <Given>") or before an address term
     ("<Given> bhai");
   * capitalised name runs (two or more name tokens, a token being an ``Xxx`` word or an initial such as "K.", so
     "<Given> K. <Surname>" and "R. K. <Surname>" are runs, and so are "<Given>-<Surname>" and "<Given> de
     <Surname>"; the PoC's bigram rule widened to whole runs so a third name word cannot survive) → ``[PERSON]``,
     unless the words are a place or ordinary words: a word is kept when
     a multi-word gazetteer phrase covers it **in the text** (so "Santosh Mitra Square" survives while "Santosh
     Mitra" alone does not), or when it is itself a generic place, civic or common English word (``road``,
     ``club``, ``school``, ``near``, ...); a lone unkept word that is a gazetteer place alias ("Visit Gariahat")
     is kept too, and initials next to kept words only stay ("B. T. Road"). A place noun never vouches for the
     words before it: "<Given> <Surname> Road" becomes "[PERSON] Road" unless the gazetteer knows the whole
     phrase, and a place noun that is not a generic word (``nagar``, ``park``, ``society``, ...; "Nagar" is also a
     surname) is redacted with the name.

6. **Indic script** (every tier; :func:`osint_common.ethics.unredactable_spans`): a Bengali or Devanagari word that
   is neither a gazetteer place (with a case ending or not) nor an ordinary word
   (``ethics.INDIC_COMMON_WORDS``) → ``[WITHHELD]``, consecutive words as one token. No Indic NER runs here, so an
   unknown word may be a name and is never guessed harmless.
7. **Model spans** (optional, OFF by default; :mod:`._model_pii`): with ``OSINT_PII_MODEL=1`` the PII-Tracer
   spans of the embedding service are merged into the first pass (``extra``): names → ``[PERSON]``, contacts
   outside the ``official`` tier → ``[CONTACT]``, never over a protected place. They only add to the rules above;
   when the service is down the rules run alone.

``n_redactions`` (a signal's ``pii_redactions``) counts every replacement: ``[PERSON]``, ``[AGE]``, ``[CONTACT]``,
``[URL]`` and ``[WITHHELD]``. No NER runs here (production swaps in IndicNER/spaCy): a Latin-script name with no
cue, no listed surname and no role noun, a single given name after an unlisted verb, an ALL-CAPS headline or a name
with non-ASCII Latin letters can survive. ``ethics.find_pii`` cannot tell (it reads the same patterns); the honest
measure is the held-out recall of ``tests/test_heldout_recall.py``. That limit is reported, never hidden.
