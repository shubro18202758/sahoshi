"""The free services that need a personal key, and how a key is read (never printed, logged or returned).

Each key is read from the process environment at call time (``~/.config/sahoshi/sahoshi.env`` reaches the service
through systemd's ``EnvironmentFile``), so a source goes live the moment its key is added and the service
restarts. Without its key a source makes no call at all and says ``needs <ENV_VAR>``.

A key never leaves this process except in the request to its own service: :func:`redact` scrubs every configured
key (and every URL query string) out of an error before it is stored or shown, and the ``httpx`` request log is kept
at WARNING so a URL carrying a key is never written to the journal.
