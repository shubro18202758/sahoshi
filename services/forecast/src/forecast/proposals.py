"""Pre-emptive diversion PROPOSALS — never actions.

For every forecast crossing (p50 V/C reaching the threshold within the horizon) one proposal object is
produced in the platform's decision-support vocabulary (osint_common C-U): ``state: proposed``, actions
in the ``CoaAction`` shape (verb, target_urn, params, requires_officer, reversible), a
``recommendation.decision: await_officer`` and a ``human_gate`` naming the role that decides
(``duty_officer``) with no officer and no decision time. Nothing here changes a signal, a road or a
message: a named officer approves, rejects or lets the proposal lapse, and if no one answers the current
plan holds.

The detour is the shortest path between the segment's end junctions on the city network that avoids the
segment itself and, where it can, every other segment forecast at or over the threshold.
