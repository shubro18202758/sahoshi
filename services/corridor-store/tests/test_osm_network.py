"""The road network on OpenStreetMap (contract C-K basis 'osm') — Kolkata's City Pack.

scripts/gen_osm_network.py --city kolkata resolves the curated spec
cities/kolkata/corridors.json on the committed extracts (cities/kolkata/osm/):
every junction on the OSM node where its roads meet, every segment traced
along its real road; it writes the fresh-install seed, the network step that
converts an existing store (reanchor_osm_network.sql), the superseded display
file, the evidence table scripts/data/osm_network.json, the resolved mapping
table scripts/data/osm_network_map.json and cities/kolkata/network.json.
Migration 020 records the provenance.

Static checks (always run, no database):
    * the ids are contiguous and the published ones stable (segments
      1001-1065, junctions 1-49 — the network_v2 hand-off), every junction
      named in English and Bengali (a landmark junction in landmarks.json's
      spelling), the camera ids are the modelled sites;
    * the generator's offline --verify passes on the committed evidence:
      Hausdorff to the OSM centreline <= 15 m, ends exactly at the junction
      points, length within 2 % of the OSM path, one strongly connected
      network, the seed and the network step carrying the evidence's
      network, the ODbL attribution in every header — and it says the
      junction-node check was not run when no extract is loaded;
    * the committed extract snapshots are the ones the evidence was built
      from, and from them (or an Overpass cache, SAHOSHI_OSM_CACHE) two
      regenerations are byte-identical and equal the committed files;
    * the network step is one guarded transaction (every write an upsert or
      a delete with a WHERE) in the splitter-safe grammar; migration 020 is
      schema only, additive, idempotent;
    * it re-anchors ONLY emulated camera reads, BEFORE the segments move —
      and the same reads, by read id, in the runs' recorded tapes (position
      only) — and writes no decision or audit table;
    * the seeded event-profile spines (008 / 010) are legal paths on this
      network; a library route the step adopts is a legal path, one that is
      not is only reported (pending); the spine and text statements move a
      value only while it is still the seeded one;
    * its network-probe line states the evidence's counts and is the line
      scripts/sahoshi_up.sh reads.

Database checks (SAHOSHI_TEST_PG_DSN names a store with 001-020 + the seed
files; every write is rolled back):
    * the store's network IS the evidence: every segment of geom_source 'osm'
      on its evidence line with no display line, junctions on their OSM
      nodes, no fabricated hourly aggregates;
    * applying the network step again changes no row;
    * 020's CHECK refuses an unknown geom_source;
    * an emulated read on a segment the step moves keeps its fraction along
      that segment (attributed by the recommendation evidence, the line it
      lies on, else its camera), a live or unattributable read stays put,
      and a second apply moves nothing;
    * the same read in a run's recorded tape follows it (payload.position
      only, every other frame byte-identical); a tape frame of a live read
      or of no stored read stays put; a second apply rewrites no tape;
    * a profile still at its seeded spine takes a new one, an operator's
      spine is kept; every stored profile spine is a legal path;
    * a profile text still at its seeded value is corrected, an operator's
      text is kept, a second apply changes nothing.
