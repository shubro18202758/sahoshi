# Third-party notices — corridor-store seed data

## OpenStreetMap (ODbL 1.0)

Sahoshi's Kolkata road network (City Pack `cities/kolkata/`) is traced on OpenStreetMap:

What is derived from it: every segment's routing geometry
(`corridor.road_segments.geom`, `geom_source = 'osm'`, the OSM way ids and the
extract's `osm_base` in `geom_meta`), the junction positions
(`corridor.junctions.osm_node_id`, each the OSM node where the junction's roads
meet), the junction movements and road graph built on them, which junctions
are signalised (an OSM `highway=traffic_signals` node within 80 m), the
MODELLED camera sites placed on the real approaches, and the agency station
positions (OSM police stations, traffic guards, fire stations and hospitals
tagged `emergency=yes`) — and, in a store the network step converts, the
positions of the EMULATED camera reads it re-anchors onto those lines
(`corridor.vehicle_sightings.position`, source `emulated_anpr`, and the same
reads inside the runs' recorded tapes, `emulator.emulation_runs.tape`: each
keeps its fraction along its segment, now interpolated on OSM-derived
geometry; these live only in the store, never in a repo file, and a
`live_anpr` read is never moved). Segment names, one-way flags and road
classes follow the OSM ways; lanes and speed limits fall back to MODELLED
class defaults where OSM carries none (`scripts/data/osm_network.json`
records which, per segment). Signal programs are MODELLED (standard cycle
templates by approach class, source `osm_assumed`), not a controller's
timings; camera sites are MODELLED because real CCTV positions are not public.
Junction names come from the pack's `landmarks.json` (EN and Bengali); a
station's Bengali name is OSM's `name:bn` where OSM carries one, else the
pack's.

Source: three Overpass API extracts (`overpass-api.de`, mirror
`maps.mail.ru`), `osm_base` airport 2026-10-28T10:51:05Z, city 2026-10-28T10:20:28Z, stations 2026-10-28T10:21:30Z.
`scripts/gen_osm_network.py --city kolkata` resolves the curated spec
`cities/kolkata/corridors.json` on them and writes every file below
(`scripts/city_build.py kolkata` runs it with every other derived file). The
extracts themselves are committed in the pack (`cities/kolkata/osm/*.overpass.json.gz`),
so a clone regenerates the same files offline and `--verify` checks them
against a regeneration; re-run the generator with `--fetch --cache DIR` (an
empty DIR) for a newer extract, which rewrites the files and the snapshot
together. The first city's network is kept as a second pack
(`cities/ahmedabad/`, with its own extracts) that the portability test builds.

| `scripts/data/osint_gazetteer.json` | the OSINT place gazetteer (`scripts/gen_osint_gazetteer.py`): the network's junctions' and road segments' OSM names and points, plus hand-placed neighbourhood and landmark points; seeds `osint.gazetteer` | `meta.licence` ("© OpenStreetMap contributors, ODbL 1.0") and `meta.source` |

Share-alike: the OSM-derived data in these files remains under ODbL 1.0
(section 4.4), whatever licence covers the code around it (the repository's
MIT `LICENSE`). A map drawn from it (the God's-eye canvas) is a Produced Work
and credits OpenStreetMap on screen; the deck's own notice is
`services/command-deck/src/lib/gods-eye/NOTICE.md`.
