"""Road and vehicles only: the person filter and the query screen.

Two guards sit around the model, both in code, so they hold whatever the
model does:

1. :func:`screen_query` refuses a person-centric or plate-reading question
   *before* the model is called ("who is in this image", "how old is the
   man", "read the number plate"). Plates are read only by the existing
   ANPR path, masked; faces and persons are never analysed.
2. :func:`scrub` removes from the model's free text every sentence that
   refers to a person at all — appearance, identity, gender, age, clothing,
   faces, ethnicity, religion, or simply "a man", "pedestrians", "a crowd".
   What remains describes the road and the vehicles. If nothing remains,
   a neutral sentence built from the road state replaces it.

The system prompt asks the model for the same thing; these functions make
sure a model that ignores the prompt still cannot put a person description
on an officer's screen.
