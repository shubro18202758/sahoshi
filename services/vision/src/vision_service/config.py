"""Configuration for the vision service (environment prefix ``VISION_``).

The service binds loopback (production port 8196). The vision-language model
runs in a llama.cpp ``llama-server`` with the Qwen3-VL projector loaded:

* ``VISION_LLM_MANAGE=1`` (default): the service starts its own
  llama-server on ``VISION_LLM_PORT`` at the first request, after checking
  MemAvailable, and stops it after ``VISION_IDLE_UNLOAD_S`` idle seconds.
* ``VISION_LLM_MANAGE=0``: it talks to an already-running server at
  ``VISION_LLM_URL`` (the compose layout, where the host runs the model).

Weights live in ``~/models/qwen3-vl-8b/`` on the GB10 host.

A start that would break the memory floor first makes room (``memroom.py``):
the other on-demand services (forecast, then speech) are asked on loopback to
release their idle models, and the same floor is checked again. Released
models reload on their next use.
